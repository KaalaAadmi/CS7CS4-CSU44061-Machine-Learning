## CS7CS4-CSU44061-Machine-Learning

Welcome to my Github repository for CS7CS4-CSU44061-Machine-Learning at Trinity College Dublin for the course year 2022-2023. This repository contains the codes for the assignments, group project, and final assignment completed by me during the course.

The repository is divided into 6 folders:

- Week 2
- Week 3
- Week 4
- Week 8
- Group
- Final Assignment

### Weekly Assignments:
The folders Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, and Week 8 contain the codes for the assignments completed during the respective weeks.

### Group Project
The Group folder contains the codes for the group project I completed. The project involved developing a machine learning algorithm to predict the rating of Dublin-based restaurants on TripAdvisor based on textual reviews. The objective was to identify the words that strongly influence the rating. I created a model that predicts the rating for any text-based review on Dublin restaurants and identifies significant words.

### Final Assignment
The Final Assignment folder contains the codes for the final assignment completed by me. The task was to evaluate the feasibility of predicting the individual ratings for accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, and value, and also the overall review rating for a listing.

I hope that the codes in this repository will be helpful to those interested in machine learning and its applications.
