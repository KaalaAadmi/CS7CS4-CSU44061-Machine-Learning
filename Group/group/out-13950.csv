"I went to Yang's restaurant in Clontarf with my family recently.  The owner and staff are super friendly. The service is great, nothing is to much trouble. You are taken good care of from the moment you enter the restaurant. I have eaten there many...times because it is so good. The food is fresh and dilicious with loads of  options on their extensive menu! In my opinion Yang's is one of the best Chinese restaurant's in Dublin. Book a table you will not be disappointed!More",5.0

"My husband's choice for his Birthday Dinner was Yang's! As usual it did not disappoint. We tried a new dish called Yin & Yang. Absolutely delicious! Also Chili crispy beef and one order of noodles. We shared this, along with a 1/4 Peking Duck starter...and a chocolate mint ice cream for desert. We split a Small Prosecco & had a bottle of 'Croix des Vents' Chardonnay.
The staff were attentive, friendly and chatty. Made us very welcome. Even tough we hadn't been there for a while you'd swear we were regulars. And we weren't rushed!
The total was 101.15 Euro which was extremely good value!More",5.0

We had a very overpriced and underwhelming meal here.  The seafood chowder was what you would expect at a pub.  The duck breast was overcooked.  The monkfish was a tiny portion served with undercooked lentils.  The desserts were pretty hideous.  The deconstructed pavlova was crap....The Christmas bread pudding was inedible fruitcake with a small teaspoon size ice cream on top.  The waiters were snobbish and irritating.  They got no tip from us.  We were expecting a great dinner based on the reviews and we were so disappointed.More,1.0

"Firstly we arrived without a booking but we're quickly made comfortable at the high tables In a warm and cosy atmosphere. 
We had been shopping for a few hours so the warm welcome was very much appreciated. We were greeted by Maureen who seated us...quickly and Hayley was promptly introduced as our server who helped us with the menu, the vegetarian, vegan options and recommended some cocktails to spice up our meal. 

The vegan Beanburger was hearty, tasty and filling which is rare in the vegan space. So much so, Hayley got the recipe from the chef for us so we can attempt our own Beanburgers at home. I find it hard to believe we'll be able to match the taste but we'll certainly give it a try. 

I had a peachy sour whiskey drink which went down very well. ""Do it for the Gram"" cocktail was less well received but hey, in for a penny in for a pound. 

Overall, it felt like we hit the jackpot with our lunch and set us up nicely to return back to the streets to finish our Christmas shopping. Highly recommended experience, will definitely visit soon.

I could not fault my graduation dinner at the bloom brasserie yesterday 05/11/2022. One of the best meals I have had in a very long time.

I will definitely be returning to the bloom brasserie in the future.More,5.0
"We ordered Chateaubriand and apple crumble for delivery. This was the third time we ordered it. First time was during the height of Covid, when dining out was not an option. We had something to celebrate - I forgot what - so decided to order...from Blooms Brasserie via click and collect. It is really convenient. And very nice food. Which is why we - still during Covid - we went back and got the same. Last Friday we treated ourselves to a Spa, I did not want to cook but fancied something a bit different. And discovered that Blooms is one of the few restaurants which are not traditionally in the delivery business that are still on click and collect. And as we really liked the meal we had before ...

The highlights of the dinner is the meat - deliciously cooked to perfection (rare) and the apple crumble dessert. The meat portion is huge. The apple crumble was last time too, but this time a little small for two people.  We added some ice cream ourselves. The mash is nice too - but again a bit more of it next time please!

But if you are looking for a nice upmarket meal that you can eat at home - I really recommend Blooms.More",5.0

It is difficult to describe, because words such as: tasty, good‚Ä¶ .. do not reflect the image of the dinner in any way.
Lunch prepared by the TANG team, Cumberland, for...the INVESCO office.
This food was like a fairy tale ...
Like a river of secrets that gradually reveal individual flavors.
Like a rainbow that shares with you its natural beauty and hope ...
Like ambrosia to the Gods of Olympus that caresses your palate .....
Like beautiful music that is a feast for the ear ...

And I would like to emphasize that only people who have good and beautiful hearts can prepare such wonderful food.
Where there is light, love and good energy.

it tastes delicious,
it looks amazing,

We loved everything about it: The vibe is casual and relaxed, warm and friendly, whilst being...attentive and professional. The food is a treat: vibrant, perfectly balanced, deeply flavorsome, and fresh - better than any Indian or Pakistani food I have eaten before. Unlike a previous reviewer, we found the portions perfect - in fact, after a starter and main course, there was no room left for dessert. 

For starters, we had the tandoori mix plate for two which was a mixture of succulent meats and seafoods - beautifully presented and outstanding.

For main courses, we had the Tandoori Jumbo prawns served with a prawn rice. Amazing - in fact, the rice alone was worth it. And the amazing cod!

The New Zealand Kapuka Sauvignon Blanc was a perfect accompaniment.

"Visited with friends after years of hearing reports of how amazing the restaurant is. We were greeted by a very friendly man and shown to our table. Our starters were presented beautifully and tasted very nice. As a vegetarian I ordered Chana Masala (as I...always do) and I certainly have had nicer/more flavourful ones elsewhere. I also found the portions on the smaller side for their price. The Pershwari Naan was very tasty. Our waitress seemed a bit more interested in chatting to a couple sitting beside us (I assume she knew them personally), which made us feel she was not too interested in our table, we had to ask several times for more water. We found the air conditioning to be very cold also but this was only toward the end of our evening so did not mention it to the staff as we were soon leaving.

Some highlights were the Parmesan bread roll, the scallop covered in grated foie gras, caviar with truffle foam, and the pigeon! I was unsure before tasting the pigeon but it was unreal!!

"Went for an evening meal and now understand what a dining experience is. I don‚Äôt generally post reviews, but can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt for this restaurant before now. We really enjoyed the tasting menu with classic wine pairing. The food was out of this world...and some of the courses simply blew our taste buds. Would never have thought of and never before encountered the combination of some of the ingredients. I actually found myself laughing with joy at how amazing some courses were. The wine pairing was a great experience too with the staff happy to share their knowledge of both the food and wine before each course. We were made feel very welcome and treated exceptionally well. The staff were obviously well trained and showed an incredible ability to adapt to what the different customers present expected in terms of service. We appreciated their professional but open and friendly approach to us. We were invited to tour the kitchen and meet the chef. Despite having delivered a very busy service and being in the middle of cleaning up for the next day Andy was willing, patient and modest in showcasing how he achieves what he does. We‚Äôve been fortunate to eat in many great restaurants, but Glovers Alley is the best experience we‚Äôve had to date. It has completely changed our perspective on dining out.

We each had the 3 course menu - the suckling pig and the duck were standout favorites at the table but I think the star was the ""tiramisu"" desert, which is not really a tiramisu but oh my goodness it was great!

The real talking point of the night was the cursing, shouting & tirade of abuse being dishing out in the kitchen for the 6/7 tables at the back of the restaurant to listen to for 10mins +.

"‚ÄúYou look fabulous!‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs one way to welcome your customers; though I have to say that ‚Äì for out first night dining out in Dublin ‚Äì we had made the sartorial effort.
We are not spring chickens and, on arrival, the clientele seemed way...younger; however, we were escorted upstairs (away from the ground-floor buzz) to a more intimate space.
Since we had only two free evenings in Dublin, I had done my internet research. So it was no surprise that the menu offered dishes that would live up to my expectations. For a starter, my partner chose the cured trout which came with slivers of cucumber, smoked roe and buttermilk lovage ‚Äì just the sort of refreshing dish to set the palate to wanting more.
I opted for the lamb-shoulder tart: a crisp tartlet filled with succulent pulled lamb, accompanied by peas, pesto and a fried quail egg. The whole ensemble was lifted by the hidden sharpness of celeriac slivers upon which the tartlet sat.
Fate would have it, for foodies such as we, that there was some mix-up with our starters order. To our surprise, the third starter choice appeared at our table: goat‚Äôs cheese panna cotta, marinated tomatoes, pickled walnut ‚Äì and a Bloody Mary sorbet! [Spoiler alert: Richmond does not have a spirits licence, so you have to have your pre-dinner G&T elsewhere; but somehow they manage the vodka for the sorbet.] Since it was too late to return the salad to the kitchen, we enjoyed it on the house.
It was the last serving time by the time we reached our mains and the catch of the day, halibut, was sold out. So the chef substituted monkfish ‚Äì who‚Äôs going to complain? My partner‚Äôs fish came simply served with a pesto sauce and baby roast potatoes.
After a meaty starter, I opted for the vegetarian choice; always a challenge for the creative chef. I wasn‚Äôt to be disappointed: butternut squash and comt√© cheese pithivier, roast cauliflower, king oyster mushroom, capers and raisins, and crispy kale. As you can imagine, great depth of flavour with interesting textures.
Alas, at a certain age, the stomach shrinks if the appetite doesn‚Äôt. So we passed on the choice of two deserts or the cheese with fig clusters, but I‚Äôm sure that they would have been equally creative.
Richmond, whose chef hails from Brighton, trained in London, and has returned to his partner‚Äôs home town, is obviously well-known to Dubliners; but for visitors to find such a gem a mere 8-minutes walk from our hotel was a both a holiday bonus and highlight.More",5.0

The whole experience was further enhanced by our lovely waitress Francesca who described each course.  I also have to mention Paul who, after chatting with us about our wine likes and dislikes, suggested a really delicious wine perfectly tailored to our palettes.  Finally Luba gave us a lovely warm welcome  and returned to our table a few times throughout the evening when he realised we were up for the chat  - and mad to practise some very rusty Italian.

"Let me start off by saying we have been to amazing restaurants throughout the world.  Michelin star restaurants, check, hard to get reservations, check, impeccable service been there done that, tasting menus with amazing wines obviously right up our alley.  While we had high expectations...we thought we had experienced similar restaurants and were prepared for this to be another good memory.  How naive we were...
 
The menu and progression of food is truly a work of art.  We left not feeling as if we had an amazing meal but an emotional experience ( similar to seeing Pavarotti perform in Fano Italy in the 2000s)  I will honestly admit I was not capable of understanding the complexity of the menu and I am sure I missed so many of the nuances built in for someone with a more educated pallet.  One of the other people  with us, who is a trained chef (not cook but chef) was so blown away by the complexity and how each course paired perfectly with the last and prepared you for the next.  

I have been in much stuffier restaurants and I think part of what lulls you in is the relaxed atmosphere.  I am frustrated with my lack of ability to describe how much we loved the food and the experience.  All I can say is it well worth every penny and will probably be in our top 5 all time experiences.More",5.0
"Chapter One was the recommendation from a chef friend who extolled the virtues of it so much so that we simply had to make a trip to Dublin to dine there. For us, a weekend break for fine dining is not unusual, although usually it's...for a 3* rather than 2* restaurant.

For a basement room, Chapter One's decor is immediately warm, cosy and welcoming, you feel right at home from the moment you enter. There are several different dining areas here each with a distinct character and feel.

The wine list has plenty of hidden gems which is what one always wants to be able to find, rather than bottle after bottle with hideous London level markups.

Of course the food is the star here, and rightly so. The dishes have firm classical roots, yet include plenty of contemporary twists and turns such that they somehow manage to be both traditional and contemporary simultaneously. The barbecued lobster is a great example of this, using so many unusual ingredients, taking one from sweet to sharp to smoky. 

These layers upon layers of flavour were apparent in pretty much every dish here, with all elements absolutely perfectly executed and the seasoning spot on. There was a real lightness of touch about everything that we enjoyed. The hare a la royale in two servings was perhaps the best example of the ultra classical juxtaposed with the contemporary.

The pastry section was just as strong, with the desserts showcasing real skill and technique and continuing to exhibit the same level of complexity as the savoury courses.

Service was warm and friendly, with the chef frequently serving many of the tables in the restaurant personally which is always a lovely touch and something one doesn't see often enough these days.

The quality of the cooking here is better than a number of 3* Michelin restaurants that we've dined at, so I wouldn't be surprised to see Michelin awarding them an extra star sometime soon. This really is a kitchen that is at the top of its game. Definitely worth a special trip to dine here - we're already looking forward to our next visit.More",5.0
"We dined here for a special occasion and were delighted that the restaurant, despite being rated 2-stars by Michelin, was quite unstuffy and no jacket was required on an unseasonally warm night. The food was really quite good with no weak dishes on the Euro...170 per person tasting menu. Service was warm an attentive throughout the evening. Looking back on the meal it was quite expensive, with dinner for two plus apertifs and three glasses of wine coming in at Euro 490. I can remember eating some really fine meals, some even in Michelin starred restaurants, for significantly less than what I paid in Chapter One. So, a fine meal indeed, at a hefty cost. Not the best meal I have eaten, but certainly in the top twenty.  Value wise, not out of line for similar establishments in Ireland, but perhaps they are all appealing to a somewhat price-insensitive demographic.More",4.0
"I feel I would be remiss if I didn't review this restaurant immediately after dining. I ate at the chef's table with three of my colleagues while in Dublin on business. We booked this sort of last minute and I honestly didn't know what to...expect. I was not disappointed. 

The food was impeccable. Each plate was flawless. Each wine pairing was perfect. 

The service exceeded my expectations. Jimmy tended to our table and delivered at a level that left me in awe.

PHX is quite trendy but the food is totally unpretentious and the prices are very reasonable. The 3 courses for ‚Ç¨33 is hard to beat for the quality on offer. The spicy wings were great and we both really enjoyed the duck for main. Prices...for drinks were really reasonable too. Service was friendly and there was a really nice atmosphere in the restaurant.

"Our impromptu drop in for early dinner exceeded exceptions. Thanks to our great server Ross for recommending the vegan steak (mushroom) with chimichurri as well as the Irish Chicken. In turn I'm paying that recommendation forward - thumbs up on both dishes. Delicious flavors perfectly...cooked.  Cozy place, welcoming staff. For those visiting Dublin, PHX is conveniently located along the Liffey and on the route of the hop on/off buses (red big bus and green dodublin bus).

Seen this cosy restaurant online with the girlfriend and decided to try it out. Walked in without a booking and luckily (because it was packed) the front of house was nice enough to tell us to wait 5 mins to see what he could do...and fair play to him got us a table. This restaurant has a cosy feel and a great value menu. We had starters which were delicious a soup and garlic baguette. Our mains a chicken supreme chicken and a steak was gorgeous the sauces amazing and i have to say a special thanks to our waiter colum very professional i like his style.

Sarah and Paula were attentive but unobtrusive.

"Close to the Temple Bar area of Dublin is a small restaurant that stands apart.  PHX (after Phoenix) is a small trendy restaurant with great food.  I had smoked mackerel cakes as an appetizer and baked hake with bread crumbs in a lemon cream sauce....They were both well-cooked, moist and flavorful.  My wife had Seared Beef Carpaccio w/truffled mushroom sauce, fried capers, and rocket lettuce, and parmesan as a starter.  It was a ""party in your mouth.""  She had Roast Irish Chicken with herb mash, and rosemary carrots all in a tasty Madeira jus reduction.  This was also delicious.  For dessert we shared a Yogurt, Vanilla, Panna Cotta sitting in Chantilly Cream, berry compote, berry sauce, and topped with almonds.  A great finish to a great meal. We had Sauvignon Blanc to go with our meals.More",5.0

The staff was very helpful and super friendly. We couldn‚Äôt leave without trying the tea. We took some Egyptian Tea and it was served in vintage cups which were sooo precious and delicate as beautiful as they were. 

It was a small place so it was quite crowded and noisy so it was a little difficult. 

One thing that I really liked as to how Halal friendly it was. They don‚Äôt sell alcohol there but people are free to bring their if they wish to do so. We also got a place for praying when we asked for it.

I chose the Sea Bass, which was chargrilled to perfection with a delicate balance of herbs and spices that enhanced the fish without being too strong: spicy potatoes were perfect with this dish  - which was a 'Master Class' in preparing fish.

It is suitable for children as well.  It was probably the best family celebration...we have been at in a long time.  The entertainment and floor display by the chefs whilst cooking was second to none (but please don't try their knife tricks at home), so we all felt in our own way that we had hand in the cooking!  Nobody was left out of the fun ‚Äì everyone has a go at ‚Äòcatching‚Äô food in their mouths ‚Äì only 2 of our party succeeded, the rest of us missed by several inches!!  The staff even came out ‚Äì two playing guitars and a young woman ‚Äì to sing Happy Birthday to the guest of honour, it really was special.  They finished off with a Michael Jackson classic too.

"Had dinner here November 2022.Lovely room, comfortable seating, elegant space. Food was quite average for the price- nicely cooked scallop starter let down by a very nondescript sauce, fillet beef beautifully done but with dauphinoise which looked like it had spent too long under a...heat lamp, and the laziest effort at a cheese plate I've ever seen in a fine dining restaurant- brie, white cheddar and something hard & French served with  slice of quince at fridge temperature which rendered the entire thing tasteless.
Service was poor- wine ordered before main courses not brought to the table until after mains were long finished, then a server who was incapable of managing to the simple sums required to split a bill equally, and finally, the cardinal sin of charging a steep 12,5% service charge for a table of 4 and presenting a card reader with the opportunity to add a gratuity.
Has all the elements to be a superb place, but needs a little more creativity with its food and to really up its game with its service.More",3.0

Disappointing meal last night. The food in general was very average and we expected a lot more based on the reputation this restaurant has. My partners duck was very tough so he could only eat half of it. The mash to share was very dense...and gluey. Drinks were good but we had to get a waiters attention both times to order more. At the end of the meal the manager seemed shocked that we weren‚Äôt very happy overall with the food even though we had mentioned this to the waitress who cleared our mains.

I have been here a few times. I always felt hungry as the portion sizes are very small. This time I believe they were even less than I expected. I asked for my lamb to be cooked pink. The server hesitated before saying she would...ask the chef to see if this was possible. I smelled a rat. When the tiny portion of lamb arrived all became clear. The lamb had been cooked in a sous vide and had a mushy consistency. It tasted awful and had no texture. I felt that the food had all been pre-prepared and simply assembled before serving. This was not a good meal by any standards. We were rushed through so much so that when it came to paying the bill the maitre D had to go outside to find our server! I am of the view that lots of restaurants are pre-preparing food so the last minute element of cooking is reduced using no waste tiny portions and providing the consumers will little or no choice. All in the interest of profit maximisation. Food critics please wake up and alert the public.More,2.0
Had been wanting to come to this restaurant for years and finally got around to it last night.

"Arrived in Dublin yesterday and stumbled across JP Mooneys.  After reading the reviews I had my heart set out on trying the establishment.  I am SO glad I did!  Great service, clean environment, good live music and FANTASTIC food!  So much so that we decided...to have lunch there today!  Darren was our sever and such a delight!  Very helpful and entertaining!  He suggested I try the coddle.  It was phenomenal!  Root vegetables were perfect and not mushy at all, just the right amount of meats and the broth was hot and silky.  Along with the mashed potatoes it was perfect for the chilly night.  My mother had the colcannon and calamari.  Potatoes were seasoned well and cabbage was tender and flavorful.  The calamari was probably some of the best I‚Äôve ever had outside of Italy!  Batter was just the right amount, squid wasn‚Äôt rubbery and the aioli, made of garlic and basil was delicious and a perfect accompaniment to the dish.  And finally the Guinness.  Couldn‚Äôt leave without one after all!  Very tasty and smooth.  Not bitter at all.  Dinner was a success.  
For lunch the following day, we decided to go back since we had visited the trinity college which lies across the street.  From the lunch menu, I ordered the Irish stew with a side of chips (or as us Americans say ‚Äúfries‚Äù).  Lamb was so tender I could cut it with a spoon, vegetables were once again perfect sitting in the broth and overall flavors were just melded perfectly together.  Chips were nicely done and not overcooked.  All in all, I really enjoyed our visit to the charming little place and have already recommended to several people to give it a try!  If I ever return to Dublin, this will definitely be my go to!More",5.0

The manager said we had to wait for others to finish so we could sit at those tables instead, which seemed strange seeing as they had plenty of space to fit us in without waiting. 

We couldn‚Äôt understand why we had to give our names for the table? The manager said it was policy but had nothing to do with Covid, it wasn‚Äôt a problem but that just didn‚Äôt make sense to us as there was a table number available and they didn‚Äôt even use our names for anything.

We also waited a while for our drinks to arrive and had to ask for more chai syrup in one of the drinks as it tasted plain.

FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!! Happy faces all round and ate every last bit. Couldn‚Äôt fault the food and the best breakfast we had our whole trip.

Overall, we would go again :)More",4.0

I chose the restaurant on the back of its Trip Advisor rating and reviews.  It has a modern layout and a very pleasant vibe.  I didn't have a reservation but was seated reasonably promptly.  I was seated at the back of the restaurant where it...was less lively and asked if I could move somewhere else but was informed the restaurant was fully booked - I was a walk in so fair enough.  I ordered Spaghetti Bolognaise - it was an average size portion served on a very large dish so the helping felt quite small.  It was hot and the pasta especially was very tasty - the sauce needed   slightly more seasoning but salt and pepper was available on the table so I was able to do this to taste.  I left feeling satisfied but was not especially overwhelmed.More,3.0

"Wow! Amazing in every way. 
We were in a Dublin for the weekend from Barry Island and this was the first thing on the ‚Äòto do‚Äô list - it didn‚Äôt disappoint! The food was absolutely fantastic- we had the fish platter between us and it...was outstanding (and we have eaten many fish platters in our time!). Each bit was packed with flavour and the sauce was superb - yes, I did ask for extra brief to mop it up! 
The staff were attentive but not in your face - knowledgeable and helpful and all around lovely.

"Where do I start? From the beginning, I suppose. We decided to go to Michael‚Äôs for my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday after years of Gaz causing us food envy on Twitter.

We were seated and looked after by the exceptionally warm and welcoming Lindsey, who made us...feel at home immediately. I knew we were onto a winner when I chanced my arm and asked was there any  garlic butter for my steak; she said no but that she would ask the chef to make some, and it was delicious. I would have been happy to settle for pepper sauce but that little touch made the meal for me.

Prior to the starters coming out, we were given warm bread with a salted caramel hazelnut butter and it was incredible; I‚Äôd buy it in bulk if it was on sale. A monkfish amuse bouche also came out and when down very well with my seafood loving girlfriend.

My medium rare ribeye steak hit the spot, while my other half‚Äôs seafood bowl was devoured and thoroughly enjoyed.

For dessert, we ordered two white chocolate raspberry cheesecakes and Lindsey produced a birthday plate with a candle to mark Amy‚Äôs birthday, which went down very well indeed.

We look forward to going back and bringing family and friends. Thank you Lindsey and team for a wonderful experience.More",5.0

"We prioritized making a reservation for this restaurant given the great reviews everywhere. After our visit the raves are understandable--each dish was better than the next.  Bread and olive oil, mussels, smoked salmon appetizer (my husband's favorite dish from our week-long trip), hake (tremendous), ricotta...and spinach malfatti were all delicious.  Wine list is very interesting. (No other alcohol is available). The place is quite small, and because of this , it seems there is an emphasis on moving folks through in order to get the next seating in. Unfortunately, this resulted in our feeling that we were being rushed through the meal.  I should say that in observing the other diners, I don't think everyone there had this feeling, but both my husband and I found it to be decidedly not relaxing.  Having said that, next time in Dublin I'm going back, because the food is just that good.  Wish I could give 4.5 stars.More",4.0

Not ideal for kids, as the tables are tight and the chef is uncompromising.

"Had a wonderful meal here. 

The restaurant has the feel of a classic bistro - the interior is plain and simple; the service is friendly and attentive and the food is truly outstanding. As with all great restaurants the passion and attention to detail are...fantastic.

We had some ‚Äúnibbles‚Äù of suppli; hake and chorizo croquettes; and sourdough bread. All really really good; the suppli and the crust of the sourdough bread slightly outshone the  croquette only because the hake and chorizo were a little lost in the croquette but it was still very enjoyable.

We had a cured salmon starter with seaweed and cucumber  which was absolutely divine - so many distinct flavours contained in this dish that worked so well.Definitely a highlight.

For our mains we had grilled hake, which was both generous and perfectly cooked, and aged parmesan ravioli with broad beans, which was absolutely wonderful. Sadly we were too full to try the deserts. 

As good as the food was it didn‚Äôt outshine the service. Our waiter was friendly; extremely attentive without ever being overbearing and his knowledge and passion for the cooking really enhanced  the whole evening.

"I think its the 5th time I've visited here over the years and noticed its getting worse each time. This year I've been twice and both occasions steak has not been great! Ask for medium and got raw steak halfway through was told ""I can...take it back and cook a bit more"" top steak places would take it back and make a fresh one! My partners was cold!

"We went to the Crowe Street location for dinner - and we arrived a little before our reservation time - but they seated us promptly. The room was beautiful and table set perfectly. The very best steak dinner I have had anywhere - US or...Continental Europe!  Service was great, the waiters could not have been more accommodating and attentive. All the steaks are aged and displayed in a case in the restaurant!  We had the 22-oz. bone-in rib eye and 8-oz, filet mignons.  The beef dripping chips were the best French fries bar none.  Wine, Guinness, broccolini and fried onion straws rounded out the meal. The two steak sauces we tried - pepper sauce and garlic butter were delicious.  Dipping the fries in the garlic butter was decadent! Too full for dessert although they looked delicious. I cannot stress what a memorable dining experience that evening was - and that's really what it's all about - good food, good service, good conversation and good friends. 10 Stars!!!More",5.0

"From the very start the menu here set out it‚Äôs stall and declared ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe with flavour. Trust me‚Äù. 

It kicked off with a delightful tomato water and this was a great refinement on the gutsy gazpacho of southern Spain. As a palate opener it...inspired confidence to jump in and enjoy and that is exactly what we did. 

An oyster presented with tarragon oil and horseradish (hear me out) was sublime. Quite apart from the fact that the oyster itself was succulent, fresh and extremely high quality, horseradish would otherwise make one a bit nervous. However, it was gently added to give a mild heat in a delightful foam. This and the great pairing of some preserved fennel, elevated this memory into the top echelon.

The sweetcorn puree with red curry and a chicken flatbread was refined comfort food giving you ALL the flavour and the emotional resonance of that dish. 

I‚Äôm not going to go through each dish but further highlights included a perfectly cooked halibut and a sorrel granita (not the same dish!)

This is a restaurant which is clear in its vision and is serving superb food at an extremely reasonable price. 

Were there any negatives? Not really, but if I‚Äôm being picky there were a couple of adjustments which could have been made to seasoning but that may simply reflect that I‚Äôm very sensitive to this and prefer to take flavours ‚Äòas they are‚Äô.

"This restaurant really deserves credit.

I‚Äôve been to a lot of restaurants in the city and I‚Äôm on animal based diet so I mainly eat steak whenever I eat out.

Featherblade is by far my favourite out of all the restaurants in town.

I ordered...2 ribeyes and 1 Featherblade steak

The ribeyes were cooked to perfection, one was medium rare and the other rare.

From someone who eats steak every day - I couldn‚Äôt believe how soft and tasty they were. The chefs cooked them perfect. 

All their steaks are grass fed which makes them even better.

I got a side of the beef dripping fries - I‚Äôm not gonna lie, these are the best I‚Äôve had and the beef dripping adds so much taste to them.

The team were very accommodating in terms of any dietary requirements. I have to avoid seed oils such as vegetable oil or rapeseed oil and they were kind enough to take that into account when cooking my steak.

A massive thanks to Molly who was our host. She made us feel so welcomed and we had a great experience because of her helpfulness. So thanks Molly!

Anytime I‚Äôm in the city - I will be eating here 110%. Best steakhouse and hospitality in Dublin.

The others who came with me vouch to say the same too. So multiply this review x3!!More",5.0

While I was working on the street, an old woman homeless asked me to play an irish song on my phone in a cold night. I've...thought that something nice may be a hot drink so by this will I entered the nearest only place open in that area asking for a TAKE-AWAY TEA (nothing more complicated then that) but it turned on to be an IMPOSSIBLE task to do especially for the MANAGER (with a mustage) OF THAT NIGHT!!  
First of all, I asked the bartender the take-away tea who showed me a real intention to make THE IMPOSSIBLE for me without even knowing the reason behind THE TEA. Then I asked if I could use the toilet and gently he gave me the direction but I could  not find it and while going back to him a voice said that the tiolet was  just for customers and surprised by the tone of superiority, almost giggling, I've  asked who he was. ""THE MANAGER"" he said.   
Hereupon, I mentioned that I was about to get a TAKE-AWAY TEA and pay the bill but the answer was that THEY DON'T PROVIDE FOR TAKE-AWAY TEA and HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. so I had to explain the story of the homelss above to let him understand but afterwards all his unprofessionalism and heartless being made everything unbelievably harder.
After hearing from him 'GO TO SPAR TO GET IT', I left the place shocked by his  behaviour and frustated because I was denied from doing a SIMPLE GEST. . 

I don't know anything about the quality of food, drinks or atmosphere there but knowing that such a person like the manager in the description is working there and he is THE MENAGER of that place, I will never go personally  or reccommend this place to anybody, people I know as a receptionist of hotel.

"All around brilliant experience from start to finish. Restaurant Six was a fantastic find to celebrate my birthday. 

On entering the restaurant, Vish greeted us with genuine warmth and grace. We were seated immediately and offered refreshments. I opted for a we started with both...a gin and vodka martinis. Both were excellent with hints of vermouth. Vish explained the dishes with ease and offers the service of the sommelier to aid in choosing appropriate wines. We were offered a complimentary appetizer to start, perhaps deep fried polenta? Regardless, it was satisfying. 

Appetizers of seared scallops with mango salsa, as well as, beets with goat cheese and pleasantly spiced candied walnuts. Both plated beautifully and quite tasty. 

We both opted for the beefs cheeks with a French wine suggested by sommelier Harold, an excellent pairing with a bit of history of the winemaker. Served at the table under a smoke filled glass cloche. Beef cheeks were succulent and seasoned well, perhaps a bit cool. The side of chive mashed potato was delicious and savory. Not so much so for the Parmesan chips, again just a bit cooler than I‚Äôm accustomed to, but still very good.

Strawberry cheesecake for dessert, 
Plated with edible flowers for another nice presentation. We were gifted another dessert of to celebrate my birthday.

On a trip to Dublin choose this restaurant based on reviews. But very disappointing. It is part of Cassidy hotel and totally overpriced for food and wine.

The pre theatre  dinner is ¬£ 32 for two courses but several items are 10 euro extra e.g. the beef.The portions are absolutely tiny and come with nothing else on the plate e,g, I got two tiny pieces of seabass and three tiny prawns while my husband got three tiny rounds of chicken.Our stomachs were rumbling halfway thru the show, The somelier is very full of himself and kept boasting about his knowledge of wine yet the wine was really a thimble full and not a glass yet cost  10 euro a glass.

The other two members of our party ordered two different dishes and said it was underwhelming and not enough. We were served the entrees first, and then the burrata shortly after. No olive oil or salt and pepper and no serving utensils for the burrata.  We had to remind the server that we had also ordered the focaccia basket. He brought out a flimsy small basket with four very thin slices of bread. When I mentioned it to the main server as we were paying the bill she said that in Italy that was focaccia. I‚Äôve been to Italy, and I‚Äôm familiar with focaccia. This was not flat bread seasoned with herbs. There were 4 thin slices of bread. She was offensive by her comment, the food was mediocre, and we will not be coming back.More",2.0

Typically I do not opt for dessert after dinner but after tasting the pasta we knew we‚Äôd be missing out on something if we skipped it.

With Neil Harney on the accordion and another fella playing the guitar and singing his heart out, the crowd was electrified!  We sang and stomped our hearts out until last call (& then some).  For our 8 day trip to Ireland, from the states, this was my favorite Pub.  I brought my 18 year old with me and this was his first pub experience.

"Beer evokes the location of production more than any other product. Weissbier and Germany, dubbels and Belgium, and most of all, Guinness and Ireland. What makes these beers unique and gives them their ""taste of place"" is a big part of what sets them apart....Rigid adequation between the product and a sense of Irishness sets it apart from other expert beer-producing nations, such Belgium or Germany. The act of consuming that distinctive national product Guinness is intimately bound up with Irish identity.

That Guinness is a synecdoche of Ireland is almost, at this stage, a cultural given. This commodity has taken on a fetishistic association with Dublin, an association that is enunciated by the desire of tourists to have a pint of Guinness as a testament to having arrived in Ireland. 

Almost every consumable item, including underwear, drinking glasses, and things related to alcohol can be bought in tourist stores with the Guinness brand on them. In fact, Guinness has served as a synecdoche in a different sense because, in the majority of Dublin pubs, if one asks the bartender for ""a pint,"" Guinness will usually be the suggested beverage.

Now that I have been to Dublin, I have embraced Guinness, its marketing, and the traditions and superstitions that surround it. Drinkers describe Guinness as a drink for which one must acquire a taste. They also frequently described the quest for the elusive ""perfect pint,"" a quest that required immense discernment on the part of the consumer‚Äîto the point that certain pubs would be earmarked as ""good Guinness pubs"" for all the right technical reasons. 

Dubliners are particularly picky about the presentation and serving of the pint. The head, for instance, needs to be the proper size, colour, and consistency. Some drinkers are so picky, in fact, that they have preferences for the bartender who served them. Most people even go as far as to claim that they would not hesitate to return a subpar pint if they received one. A bad pint could be a flat pint, a pint with a ""bad"" head, a pint with a ""bishop‚Äôs collar"" (too much head), or any combination of these. Guinness drinkers tend to show a high degree of assertiveness as consumers, demonstrating a strong sense of consumer sovereignty. Consumer intelligence at such elevated levels suggests a high level of involvement and engagement with the product.

But why all this work to ensure a good pint? Why stick with a product that, on first taste, is often unpleasant? Why chase what is often perceived to be an elusive pint? Why work so hard at establishing where and when you will find this product  acceptable? Why order a drink that takes several minutes to arrive if it is to be served properly? Why this delayed gratification? Why persevere?

The beliefs that surround the beverage, the rituals that support these myths, and the sense of tradition and community that arises from all of these contributing aspects are undoubtedly some of the key reasons people continue to drink Guinness.

Guinness drinkers even report feeling a sense of tradition and an inherited cultural value. Numerous elements, including their knowledge, experiences, social histories, and personal exposure, have influenced their perspectives. These, however, are not the sole components of the narrative. The use of the product is intricately tied with the use of its well-known commercials, as well as the rituals, mythologies, rites, and traditions that surround and support it.

The staff at Devitts know this, of course. And will smile wryly whilst pouring you a pint before leaving it to settle. Why does it need to settle, you may ask? Because good things come to those who wait.More",5.0

"I organised a Dinner for a big group from work. There were about 20 of us. Lemon and Duke did an amazing job in accommodating us. Firstly the restaurant was so festive and well decorated and put everyone in the Christmas mood. The staff were...very attentive with all our food/drink requests and quick to respond. They managed us very well, which I know would have been hard since we were a large group. The food was also 10/10 very delicious. We couldn‚Äôt all fit on one table which was harder to manage but after our 3 course meal they had arranged a private area for us to stay in which was great as everyone could then move about freely. There was great attention to detail.

"Mulligans serves the perfect pint, delicious wine and gorgeous food with the friendliest most attentive staff. Once I decided to organise a 50th, noting I was clearly far too young to be 50, the location was obvious. Mulligans didn't disappoint, rather they hit the ball...out of the park. No surprise to local guests but the feedback from those new to Mulligans was universally glowing, with everyone commenting on all the elements listed above.  Well done Team MulligansMore",5.0

"Not wanting to leave the comfort blanket of Sandymount and travel into town I decided to  venture to Mulligans Sandymount for some well earned dinner with a friend. Feeling adventurous we requested the specials menu which was delightfully presented by the ever friendly and engaging...Renata. We both opted for the lamb shank served on a bed of mash potatoes, mushrooms and onions. The food arrived promptly and we were not disappointed. The lamb was exceptional, tender and plentiful and as good as any I have tasted on my travels. Definitely hoping that this one makes it to the main menu as it could threaten to push my usual favourite of Fish & Chips off pole position. Service as usual was top class and looking forward to my return.

"I‚Äôm from Sandymount and I have been coming to Mulligans since it opened. About 13 years ago. 

It was a great pub with staff like Gerry, Paul and Ian. 

Now it is unrecognisable. 

Foreign Staff with a poor grasp of English prevails.  ‚ÄúWhat is Chardonnay?‚Äù...Said an Indian girl. 

The Portuguese girl should chose a different career. When I asked for some tomato sauce I get a shout, ‚ÄúIt Come now, It come now‚Äù

Young lad with beard reading a newspaper under the counter so I had to get off my seat to get a drink. 

The staff conversation behind the bar about their social lives seems to take precedent over a heads up look for customer approach. I‚Äôm not interested in their weekends 

There is phrase in business called ‚Äú sweating the asset‚Äù and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on here. 

Kieran, any chance you could make it a local again? At least train the staff away from ‚Äú wha you want‚Äù 

It is Dublin 4 FFS.

"After reading all the positive reviews on Mulligans I decided to try it out for myself and see what all the fuss was about. 
On arriving at the restaurant the floor staff where quick to bring us to our seat and check our Covid pass....The menu looked pretty good so we decided to start with a large plate of wings between 3 of us. The winds where super hot and delicious. 
For mains I ordered a chicken supreme ( it was called something different on the menu) and my two guests both ordered Fish and chips. 
Firstly presentation was absolutely beautiful, the chicken was cooked to perfection. But the roast potatoes which I was most looking forward looked really crispy but on cutting into them them resembled a raw potato the roast potato‚Äôs had been undercooked. What a let down. 
My guests enjoyed both there fish and chips dishes but the twice cooked chips looked like they had been undercooked and where pale. 
I would give mulligans another go later in the year as I hope the issue with the fries and roast potato was a once off.More",3.0

Then...the Food. I had the crispy sea bass with rice and vegetables. Unfortunatley the fish tasted really bad. I honestly think it was frozen and definitly not fresh. Same for the vegetables. Rice was okay, but it‚Äòs just rice so you know what I mean.

Inside, it felt like a cross between a NY deli with a gastro pub feel....The brunch menu was only avail (on weekends) and they were sadly out of Eggs Benedict (which I took as a good sign). 

All that really jumped out to me at that point was the burger. I actually considered leaving but ended up deciding to stay. Holy cow am I happy I did. 

The burger was a work of art. Perhaps the best one I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The waitress was delightful and smart and a great conversationalist.

The downside was we were seated inside by the door to the outside terrace. It simply wasn't warm enough. I eventually had to go and put my coat on. The other thing I would take care of is the music. I know it's a subjective thing but listening to hits of the 80's (Dire Straits etc.) wasn't a pleasant aural sensation. It sounded like the music you might hear in Supervalu or a lift.

We were in Ballsbridge and we weren‚Äôt sure where to eat. We stumbled across this gem. From the moment we arrived we were impressed with the relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant. We were very pleasantly greeted by the manager who assured us any dietary needs...could be catered for with no problem whatsoever. Allowing that we had a coeliac in the group the food arrived out very quickly and even if we had 2 hours for every course if was worth it. The food was some of the nicest I‚Äôve ever had. The manager and her colleague (I didn‚Äôt catch her name) made sure your every need was catered for. I really can‚Äôt recommend this place enough and I think some 5* hotels would struggle to compete with the quality of the food and staff.More,5.0

"We booked a table in the Girl and the Goose for a party of 12 for a double birthday, having heard great reviews of the restaurant in the past, we were eager to try it. 
we were not disappointed, 
The minute we entered we were...taken care of from every request, drinks were served and we were left time to look at the beautiful menu, 

the menu is simple but hits all the right points, steak, pork, fish, burger and vegetarian options, without being over cluttered, or too busy, 

most of the party ordered the duck and goose croquettes which were a resounding success, myself I can't turn down a good parfait, and this it was, 
the lightly toasted sourdough toast with a cranberry conserve that complimented the parfait perfectly was a great start to the meal, 
another person ordered the goats cheese starter which by all accounts was a great as it looked

for mains I got the slow cooked pork belly, 
it was tender, juicy and packed with flavour, 
half an apple upon two roulades of pork belly on a bed of perfectly cooked mash and cabbage,  i didn't want it to end, 

the steaks looked incredible, all cooked exactly as requested with an option to have it served on a hot stone, 
I got to taste the chicken supreme also and supreme is probably the perfect work for it, 
stuffed with roasted red peppers and chorizo on a bed of roasted root vegetables, amazing!

For dessert we opted to book a cake with the restaurant after seeing their cakes on Instagram, 
they asked what type of cakes the birthday guest likes and we told them he likes vanilla cream with fruit
we didn't want anything ""Too"" fussy, no mad carved cakes,  just a standard cake, and we expected a cake with icing and maybe some chocolate, 

what we didn't expect was the absolute piece of art we were presented with, 
a multi levelled strawberry and cream filled cake, adorned with Kinder Buenos, Ferrero Rocher, sweet waffles and donuts, with chocolate drip down the side,
we expected this to sit like a tonne of bricks when we saw it first, but the inside was light, fruity and airy, most of us went back for seconds, 

the atmosphere in the restaurant was lovely, really felt like a guest room in your own house,  with the muted lighting and the elegant d√©cor,

the attention to detail from the staff, particularly Davide was perfect, 
 you need barely realise you were out of a drink or that you needed something and he would be present for any request, without being overbearing and never making us feel like he was hovering about 

Michal the chef and owner found a minute to check on us after our meal and make sure everything was just right, which of course it was and Zuzanna our host was incredibly kind and attentive, 

checking in from time to time to check if we needed anything else, or when to bring the cake for example, 

we finished quite late as we had a late evening booking, but there was no air of urgency in us leaving , or moving on, 
the whole ambiance was very relaxed and felt homely, 

I will be coming back to The Girl and the Goose and will be introducing as many people as I can to their food,  and the experience you get in this wonderful restaurantMore",5.0

I rarely eat out because unfortunately I have a lot of food intolerances. If I go away I have to stay in self catering for fear of getting ill. My husband convinced me to stay in a hotel and we decided to try and eat...out. Its such a rare occasion for me and a risk. I contacted the restaurant in advance to explain my situation and how limited my choices were. I basically needed to order a very specific meal which wasn't on the menu (some of the ingredients were being used in the restaurant but it was a specially prepared meal just for me). Michael himself corresponded with me. He was so kind and helpful and had no issue with my request. What followed was the most perfect evening. My meal was so delicious and it was such a treat to not have to cook and to be able to socialise with my husband. The service was excellent. My husband was delighted with his meal too! Michael and his amazing team and restaurant will have no idea of how much it meant to me. It truly was the perfect evening. This is a lovely restaurant with an amazing menu and great service.

"I would say Pickle is the best Indian restaurant in Dublin but that would do it a disservice - this is one of the very best restaurants in the city full stop.

The menu is extensive and full of delights but for the full experience,...I would recommend getting the tasting menu, a very reasonable ‚Ç¨65 for five courses with a wine pairing for another ‚Ç¨35. The quality of the food is consistently excellent, with elegant presentation and rich, complex flavours all round. Whatever you order, you can be confident it will be excellent. The restaurant prides itself on providing nice surprises through the tasting menu, so I will preserve this by not going too far into the specifics of the food we were served during our recent visit.

The service is great too, and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, an elderly man became angry and tried to cause a scene during my visit but the staff dealt with this quickly and discreetly, preserving the convivial atmosphere for the other diners.

The one tiny criticism I have is that the wine pairing for the tasting menu was a little bit 'safe', but this is an extremely minor criticism, as the wines were still well-chosen.

This is one of the best restaurants in the city, and a must-visit for anyone who enjoys North Indian food.More",5.0

For starters we settled on some chicken momo (steamed dumplings - a bit like dim sum) and chicken lollypops which were divine. For mains we had a mix of mild/medium curries including a Nepalese variant of biryani (sages' rice) that was simply divine.

The wine list is exhaustive and impressive although my wife and I settled on beer as that's what we were in the mood for.

Very big portions, so unfortunately we couldn't sample desert. Didn't think it was overly expensive for what we got. Would definitely return when next in the area.More",5.0

We were looking for somewhere special to celebrate our daughters birthday and we were not disappointed with this wonderful restaurant!. It was doubtless the best Indian food we have had locally and the service we got was second to none. Fantastic!

In fact, when I completed the owner - a few minutes later he gave me a complementary portion to take away.

The waiting staff were super and attentive and the restaurant was beautifully designed.

Rasam is authentic and daring using real Indian spices and ingredients to create a delightful experience.
From Old Delhi Butter Chicken  to Guntur Kodi Kura , you can experience flavours of...the North and the South of India. 
Unusual spices like Stone Flower and fresh (yes fresh!) curry leaves authenticate the food.
Great friendly service with tables laid out so you are not literally rubbing shoulders with complete strangers, and subdued lighting make for a relaxing dining experience.

"It is rare that I frequent a restaurant. And this place I have been frequenting for the last 9 years at least once every 2 months. 

The best way to describe it is feeling at home with a friendly welcome and amazing food. Every dish...is traditional and IT IS a tapas place. 

Many places in Dublin call themselves a tapas place but they always fall short. These guys are always reinventing dishes or travelling to improve on them. Most of the staff is Spanish so you know for sure you are getting authentic Spanish food.

Every dish is unique and delicate. It is a perfect place for sharing and trying out new things. Trust me, if you have the opportunity to visit (cause they always seem to be booked out) you will not be disappointed. 

The sea food is so tasty and fresh with a lovely spice. My favourite are the Gambas al Ajillo. Unfortunately they changed the menu and had a lovely black ink rice which I thought was to die for. Maybe they‚Äôll bring it back. One can hope

The meat dishes are very well seasoned and nothing seems to be over or under. It is rare that all is Just Right. The Bomba Barceloneta is amazing. Consistency in this place is unreal. It is like an unwritten rule.

Vegetarian dishes also seem to hit the mark really well. From the pimientos Padr√≥n to the setas (mushrooms). 

The portions are generous and if you are feeling adventurous, order stuff you wouldn‚Äôt usually. After all, it is an experience and this is a brilliant one to share or just try out on your own!

The wine is reasonably priced and have a great selection too. 

Ask for Vanessa or Anna. They are proud owners of a place that is worth writing home about. 

I really can‚Äôt recommend enough.More",5.0
"I am looking at reviews on this site and wondering have I got the wrong end of the stick regarding this restaurant but as the old adage goes, it's not what somebody said but how you were made to feel. I had booked this meal...for a first sitting from 7.15 for a group of girls celebrating three birthdays, and we were looking forward to it. 
However, from the moment we arrived to when the last morsel of food was cleared from our plates, we felt rushed out the door. We spent over 350 euro and feel that is not to be scoffed at. At first, the waiter informed us to double up on our food orders which  had a touch of the upselling about it. We're hardly novice tapas eaters in this day and age. Also, our friend arrived ten minutes late and was informed she couldn't order a particular dish because it wouldn't be ready in time and there was enough already on the table.  This, I find highly insulting and cheeky, if not ridiculous. I wonder about Dublin restaurants now and making up for lost profits and time due to Covid 19. Restaurants must also, remember not to bite the hand that feeds you. A popular restaurant such as this should surely have a more professional approach with paying customers. I have eaten here before at less busy times and thought it was a lovely restaurant, hence the booking. We were all sorely disappointed and will not be recommending or booking here again.More",2.0
"We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in Las Tapas de Lola. As we had originally met in Spain, we felt that was appropriate. Having eaten tapas in many places over the years, our expectations were high and we certainly weren't disappointed.  The menu cleverly meets...a wide range of tastes without being too overwhelming. We chose to have Pa amb tomaquet (we are more familiar with southern tapas and wanted to try something from the north) and manchego cheese with honey, and a drink, while we perused the menu. We then chose six further tapas and to be honest couldn't move afterwards! Each of our choices was different from the last and each was excellent.  The berenjenas were excellent and my favourite pimientos de padr√≥n were perfect. The service was both friendly and attentive, the ambiance  welcoming and authentic.

"Don't be put off by appearances...the interior of Umi Falafel looks quite basic but the service and food more than makes up for it,  Once stuck into eating I felt I could have been in a restaurant anywhere in the Lebanon or the Holy Land....We had a lovely waitress who was very helpful and we were delighted to see the Covid guidlines being adhered to.

The falafel comes in a sandwich or a wrap with a choice of two standard falafels (The Lebanese Falafel and The Palestinian Falafel) or you have the option to order 'Falafel Your Way' with falafel (of course) and a choice of four fllings from a very tempting list of ten choices plus one of six sauces!  This is what we did.

There were other sandwiches including Grilled Haloumi Cheese and a super Mezze Menu with such tempting Middle-Eastern delights as Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Labneh, Stuffed Vine Leaves, Spinach & Filo Rolls or Batata Hara (or spiced potato wedges) - and I can vouch for how good the wedges were.

They also have an excellent range of salads which come in very generous portions - we shared one as a side dish and struggled to finish it because it was so big,

There are meal deals etc which are well worth checking out.  I wasn't able for a desert but I must say the choice of Baklava or Basboussa was more than tempting.

We opted for the mited lemonade (made fresh daily) and it was an unusual but wonderful accompaniment to our food but there are other very tempting juices and soft drinks avaiable too.

This was my first experience of Umi Falafel but I will definitely be back and will keep an eye out for other Umi Falafel branches on my travels.

"I was really looking forward to this meal having seen all the good reviews. In particular, my friend was excited about all the innovative looking vegetarian options. 

For starters we had the Mushroom Tacos and the Cauliflower Tartare. Both were underwhelming. The tacos were way...over seasoned and the cauliflower dish basically tasteless. For mains I had the Chilli and Lime Prawn Salad and my friend had the Lentil and Mushroom Burger. My prawns were small, over seasoned and I could only taste salt and very little chilli. The salad part was awful, drowned in a vinegary, salty dressing. In fairness, the burger was good. It tasted nice and had a great texture. So 3 out of 4 dishes were bad and one was good. 

The prices are pretty reasonable for Dublin so we didn't feel ripped off. The service was efficient, attentive and polite, however there was something cold and clinical about it i.e. not very friendly. The restaurant was full and buzzing and the art theme was OK.

Overall my impression is this place is all about the sizzle, the look but it has little heart or soul and not enough attention paid to the taste of the food. Obviously I am in the minority so maybe the chef had an off night but I won't be rushing back to find out.More",2.0

"Me and the wife like to go to town at the weekend. Sometimes we go for food and sometimes we go to the Cinema or the theatre. We always like a few pints afterwards and frequently head for The Palace on Fleet street in Dublin....It's an old bar with a long run, a snug and a reading room at the back. It also has an upstairs section. We like to sit at the Bar at the front. This puts you in close contact with the Bar staff and the other patrons. 
You have to be patient to get a bar stool but there is a decent turnover and if you are prepared to wait you will be rewarded with a couple of stools.

So the Guinness is great. Now you might say that it is good everywhere now and you would be right. But The Palace Guinness Pints are next level great. Unusually great. Sublime. Without equal. Unbeatable. Supremely good. You getting my point here?

The combination of the very old style ambiance, the patrons close quarters and the sublime Guinness leads to inevitable interactions with the patrons. This is usually hilarious and extremely entertaining. The bar staff are also good craic and often interject in the communal conversations. 

This institution is one of the last real Dublin Bars and is unequaled in its ability to deliver on every occasion. So if you are in around the City of Dublin anywhere near O Connell Bridge The Palace is very close by and definitely merits a visit.

I was honestly itching to go elsewhere but I was running late on my own plans so I still chose to get the drink but their service is garbage. I really wanted to like this place too but my 24 hours in Dublin has not been the best. I felt a lot of subtle racism here (in Dublin) and this place was no different. I did notice, after I was finally helped, 2 guys approached the counter and the other girl immediately assisted them.More",3.0

"I am a coach driver and Failte Ireland qualified tourist guide. My recent visit was in this capacity. So before I write my review, I want to state that I have absolutely no relationship with this establishment, neither private nor professionally. 

The downstairs pub has...an ""authentic Irish"" atmosphere. Yes, the place aims at attracting tourists but they do not overdo it.

The show is on the upstairs floor. Music, songs and Irish dance. Especially the uilleann piper was superb, so was the bodhran player. The show was worth a visit just for hearing those two authentic Irish instruments alone.  
The banter was just right, not too ""corny"", no ""top of the morning"" quasi-Irish style.
The dancers were good too. A good display of Irish culture.

The food was very good, above average. Tasty and well presented, and served promptly, taking into account that the audience are seated at long trestle tables.

Service was polite and the management made certain that everyone was  made to feel welcome.

Yes, I know,  I repeat :This show iaims at attracting tourists, and it will not be to  everyone's taste.

As probably most couples do, we picked at each other‚Äôs starter‚Ä¶ tasted each other‚Äôs mains etc. I had the nachos with sour cream so there was plenty for the two of us to eat! Himself got a pint of Guinness. To our disbelief there was a dark hair circled around the head of the pint. Considering we are regulars, he actually didn‚Äôt want to say anything but I said we would have too. So I did but in a nice way. We got an apology and a new pint was given‚Ä¶ as you can probably tell we don‚Äôt like to complain as others would have a field day on this alone. We had the full 3 courses‚Ä¶.

"I, and three friends visited this restaurant last night. The staff and atmosphere in the restaurant was wonderful. We had the pescatarian and vegetarian menus. The food was delicious, however when we pointed out that the monkfish was cool and the potato pur√©e, served to...accompany it, was cold we were told that is how it‚Äôs served.

"Service was very poor. We arrived 20 minutes early and were told our table wasn't ready (despite the table immediately in front of us being available). We were advised to go to the cocktail bar (fair enough) but this area was full so we were...sent back to the restaurant and seated at the originally empty table we saw previously. My point is that there really should be a mechanism for communication between the bar and restaurant to avoid this happening. 

Later, and as this is a restaurant with an associated cocktail bar my friend asked for a martini (which wasn't on the restaurant cocktail menu) but as it had it's own cocktail bar we thought this was a reasonable ask. There was some eye rolling from staff when asked for a martini but they facilitated. For the second round I decided to go to the cocktail bar to directly order the martini and bring this to the table to avoid any inconvenience for and resistance from staff but I was rudely (in my opinion) told that there is a set menu which didn't contain Martinis, but they would make they exception for us this one time. Just to note that I brought money so as to avoid setting up 2 tabs in different areas of the restaurant which would be an understandable nuisance. 

As an aside when they poured my pint of Guinness at the half way point of pouring the pint the staff member clearly poured too much head and proceeded to scoup out the excess head with a spoon into a glass. She then poured more head and then service this to me - see photo. 

Overall we felt very uncomfortable and as though we were an inconvenience for staff. We were not happy with the service at Delahunt and would therefore not return.More",1.0
"Wow what a surprise!. Went for a citytrip to Dublin and stayed not that far from this remarkable restaurant. During the weekend they serve a delicious 'tasting menu' with some fine and tasty combinations. 
We received a warm welcome and the service - women power...in the restaurant and men power in the kitchen brought a special touch and vibe. We enjoyed the lively atmosphere but even the professional service at our table. Food was delicious and I believe that they have a good note from the guide Michelin as well. To be honest they deserve it!!! As from the starters we knew that this evening would be a special one. Scallops with asparagus, ricotta agnolotti, black leg chicken, Wicklow's blue, and a lovely dessert.  Together with this all we ordered a 'special' sparkling wine 'Bulli', an Italian vino frizzante with a special, but delicious taste! Overall  we had a wonderful culinary evening in this characteristic house on Camden Street Lower, Dublin. Great team in the restaurant and a superb team in the kitchen! Certainly worth a visit but be sure to make a reservation!More",5.0
"We purchased an expensive pre-set four course dinner.  The first half of the meal, and service throughout, were 5 star quality.   The meal tailed off towards the end, then ended with a thud on the dessert, which had coconut.  We told the server we hated...coconut and asked if it could be removed from the dessert.  The dessert was served with coconut because the chef felt presentation was more important than whether the customer liked or hated it.  The coconut was sprinkled on and could have easily been left off.  Because of the chefs arrogance I would not recommend this restaurant.More",3.0

The size of the courses was perfect, small enough not to be overwhelmed, but large enough that you could properly enjoy each dish; we were stuffed by the end though- particularly when we were brought petit fours at the end as an anniversary surprise! 

The staff were all very attentive and quick to re-fill water etc, they were all also very knowledgeable about the food the were serving. 

A perfect evening, thank you; we have recommended Delahunt to friends and would definitely be keen for a return visit.

If you order wine by the glass they will give you a pour you would not serve your worst enemy if he was dining in your home, if you bring it up to management they act as if you are begging for more , pour you more , and ignore you the rest of the night!

"Myself, my partner and another couple where hoping to visit this restaurant in a weeks time. My partner had received a gift voucher for ‚Ç¨100 but we had mislaid it during a move. I know it is somewhere in the house but cannot find it....I contacted the restaurant by email with a copy of the purchase order email and asked if they could honour the voucher? The reply was that they treat the voucher like cash so if you lose the voucher, you lose your money.

I then asked if the voucher had been redeemed and they stated that it had not been used. I really can't understand why they could not cancel the original voucher and send us a new one. Surely if a group of 4 people are going to be ordering the tasting menu at ‚Ç¨235 pp not including wine, they would be willing to help, but sadly no they weren't.

What seems to be ""off"" if is a lack of inventiveness and some rather odd additions - bowl of mash potato just appeared on the table (why?, I don't know).

"Fish shack was one of my favourite local spots. However, my experience today was hugely disappointing. Two of us ordered the fish and chips, both of us experienced in cooking and knowing what fish should taste like. Our fish was borderline inedible. It was totally...over cooked; the batter was burnt, chewy and dense. Batter should be light, fluffy and crisp. The fish was rubbery, rough, dry and rigid. It should be soft, flakey and moist. I tried both pieces and couldn‚Äôt eat it. When asked by the waitress I said it was very over cooked. She apologised and offered a replacement but I was in a rush and frankly not bothered to order something else as all the different fish orders on our table were over cooked as well. When the bill came, l said I wouldn‚Äôt pay for the fish as it really was terrible. Even worse was the waiters attitude; she brought my barely touched fish back to the kitchen and the chefs refused to accept the fact that it was obviously over cooked. The waiter argued with me for about 5 mins. She said ‚Äúhow long have you been chefs?‚Äù, and said ‚Äúsometimes it‚Äôs the customer‚Äù that‚Äôs the problem, she said I was being really unfair and that she hopes I‚Äôm happy very sarcastically. Our reply to this comment regarding our knowledge of cooking fish, we said that one of us has a family restaurant with their parents. She replied with ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you bring them down here to let them see‚Äù. It was a horrible experience that left me really anxious and shaky. I won‚Äôt be returning here, instead I will go down the road to bubba‚Äôs in dalkey. Far more friendly staff and better fish.More",1.0

The batter can be very salty, do please go easy on the salt in the batter. 
 I recently discovered that Fish Shack also exists in Malahide so I decided to try it out there also. To my lovely surprise there is outdoor serving, so when the weather is good it is a lovely spot. 
I then decided to over for a meal in the Malahide restaurant and booked in person in a restaurant after having a light dinner there. I agreed with the manager Jamie where I wanted to sit with my family. He even took my phone number.
So I arrive on the day and time but sadly, my two tables that I had reserved had been given to other people. Jamie then tells me it was booked for 12 people. My family and I  are then given another two tables that hadn't even been prepared in the furthest corner in the outdoor area. I then see my two tables become free. The 12 people party comes in, a bunch of young women. But there's only 8 of them.How did this happen Fish Shack Jamie? 
I am bringing a party of 8 people and order generously from your menu as it is a family celebration.
But I am afraid your service and mess up with my reservation soured my evening. Anyway the dishes are very average, nothing to write home about so I will be taken my custom elsewhere. Goodbye Fish Shack. I hope you get a new recipe for your fishbatter.More",2.0

"Myself and my partner have been to Fish Shack quite a lot over the past number of years. 

If you have read any of my other reviews, you will know how important it is to me to receive simple, tasty, well cooked food and Fish...Shack always gives us this reliability. 

We usually like to come here on Friday nights - though I should add we have not been since before Lockdown so I cannot comment on the safety measures. The restaurant varies in busy-ness, sometimes it is heaving and has a fabulous atmosphere and others it is quiet but still cosy. The decor always helps the atmosphere as the wood interiors always make it feel warm and cosy. 

We usually share a couple of dishes when we come here and the Fish Shack platter which changes regularly is usually our go to - though there is often calamari on the platter, we will usually get a platter of calamari too. It is definitely the best calamari I have had in this city. Always crispy and the squid is tender - it is served with a chilli jam and is a fabulous combo. We will usually get muscles and chips as well and a garlic mayo - all of which are always gorgeous. The chips are thick cut - think chipper chips but super fresh and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The muscles are always absolutely delicious. 

There was one occasion when we had the muscles and they tasted slightly strange - this has happened to me a number of times in different restaurants across the country, and I am still yet to figure out the issue but we let the lovely staff member know and she changed it right away and the manager came to apologise and mentioned they had changed the batch of muscles. It was just really well handled and the second portion was perfect! 

The desserts in Fish Shack are always top notch and you can tell they are made in house - they usually have things like oreo or baileys cheesecake and key lime pie and they are served in ramekins so look lovely and are always tasty. 

The price is always super affordable for us, with the platter, a portion of calamari, chips, muscles, a dessert, a beer and a soft drink we would usually pay about ‚Ç¨25-30 each.More",4.0

I'm not usually a big potted crab and shrimp fan since most of the time its a bit too creamy with barely any fish in there but Fish Shack had the complete opposite phenomenon where they barely had any cream in there and it was all just delicious crab and shrimp goodness.

"I had really high hopes for Bar Italia after reading reviews as well as hearing from a friend how amazing this place was. The food was honestly amazing - each member of our party had the truffle pasta and honestly I thought it was the...closest to true Italian food that we could get. The service however was a completely different story. We had a reservation and while we were seated right away, we were seated down in the basement where everyone was crammed together and packed in like sardines. Our waiter was honestly the worst and it took 30 minutes and 5 reminders for us to get tap water. When he did finally come back with tap water he rushed us to order and then didn't come check on us for the remainder of the meal. A female waitress checked on us throughout the meal and we thought she had taken over our table, until the end when our original waiter came over to clear our plate. Now I know in Europe it's common for staff to let you sit and wait and ask for the check, but when we did finally ask for the check he grumbled and made it seem like an inconvenience for him to cash us out. Nevertheless, I still give this restaurant a 3/5 because the food was amazing and I'm sure if we had a different experience with the staff this review would have been a 5/5. If you choose to dine here request to sit upstairs :)More",3.0

What put a complete dampener on the experience was...the man who is at front of house (I didn‚Äôt catch his name). He gave us no printed bill when we were paying, but upon leaving the restaurant something wasn‚Äôt adding up for us and we all agreed we felt we had been overcharged somewhere.  Myself and one other girl from the party went back inside and explained we‚Äôd wait until he had dealt with the customers waiting to be seated, but we wanted to have a chat about the bill.  
When we asked for a copy of the bill, he produced a handwritten illegible docket that had been used by the staff to put our bill together.  We obviously couldn‚Äôt understand it at all and when we questioned the bill again, he was rude, very unhelpful and spoke to us as if we were completing wasting his time.  
It turned out we had been overcharged for 5 cocktails coming to almost ‚Ç¨60.  We didn‚Äôt get an apology or any acknowledgement of a sorry for the way he had treated us.  
Mistakes happen, I have worked in this industry for years when I was in school/college and feel I am understanding.  On top of this I had to call back a week later with my card details for my ‚Ç¨100 deposit to be refunded, after he had assured me he would call me.  
I recognised it was this same man on the phone and again no apology.  Such a shame he completely lacks any form of customer service and is so far beyond the kindness and professionalism of the rest of the staff who work there!More",4.0

The complimentary Manora Shrimp Chips (Spicy Prawn Crackers) are more-ish. You have to be careful you don't fill up on them before your meal arrives üòÇ. Three Evening Special meals.

The main meals, Crispy Beef, Sweet and Sour Pork and Singapore Noodles (really spicy, how Singapore Noodles should be). Absolutely stuffed! Sadly I couldn't eat it all but we were able to take the rest home so that's lunch sorted for tomorrow. Dessert, there is always room for ice cream and Viennetta.

Susan chose duck spring rolls and beef with black bean sauce accompanied by boiled rice.  As she chose to have only soft drinks on Tuesday night I did not want to order a full bottle of wine.  However, I was able to choose a half bottle of a very drinkable Sauvignon Blanc by Torres.  The food was delicious and to our shame we managed to find room for a dessert.  I chose little crispy dumplings with nutella and chocolate sauce.  Susan selected mint ice cream.  I also asked for a double measure of Baileys over ice and a latte coffee.

There was good labelling on the menu of what allergens each dish contained and all but one main dish was labelled as containing either fish or crustaceans. We asked if they could make these dishes without any fish/oyster sauce and were told this was not possible because the sauces were already made. We left and ate elsewhere.

On my last visit, my ribeye was so bad I just had the waiter box it up for the dog. This time I couldn‚Äôt even cut it properly because there was so much gristle. I left half of it on the plate.

"The Lavanda restaurant sits behind Smithfield square. Its location is not conducive to a great patron-ship although the waiter said that they were doing good. I am saying this because when we walked in, there was only one table of three occupied and for me,...it could mean a lot because of the lack of customers. I usually avoid.  Yet again, we gave it a try. The theme is rather bizarre. A blackboard advertizing a lamb shank and another one with maquerelle. The owners are Croatin. Maybe both mix. Oh well. We went for the ""venaison platter"" for an appetizer. A mere plate with three pieces of ""pate's"" that could have been pork. But again, very good with a chutney that was delicious. This was a business lunch/dinner and I took the duck confit and my colleague the spicy chicken. Both plates were good. Nothing to go to a presentation competition but, good. The menu was very limited which is the reason I will not go back there. But for a one-off, its worth it!More",3.0

Her sparking personality enhanced our meal. What a wonderful evening in a great Irish pub & restaurant. 
Fast-forward 2 weeks and we were back in Dublin for a couple of nights. This time we decided to give another nearby recommended establishment a try. After finding that not all recommendations lead to the best places, we decided to head back to D & N. Wow. Really, wow.

Once again, both the food and the service were stellar. We even got to see Debbie again.

I am 33 years old and I had the best drinks there that I have ever...had in my entire life, one of them being the Purple Pearl and the other being Dirty Wizard. We also had the most amazing bartenders/waitresses by the name of Janessa and Laura. They made the experience that much better for us with their kindness, knowledge of the menu, and overall awesome personalities. I am already making plans to go back to Dublin and stop by here to try out more drinks and visit this amazing speakeasy/bar that really was unforgettable for my partner and I.

Once you've found the black door and rang the doorbell, someone comes down and shows you to your table. We all gasped as we walked in, we didnt really know what to expect, it was so cosy, all lit up with candles, it was just amazing. 
We were seated in the corner with the velvet curtains around us, beautiful little area with lovely decor. 
Choice of cocktails was fantastic, some great creations on offer. We literally wanted to sit here all afternoon!More",5.0

"I visited here for my friends 50th. At first we were a bit taken aback, couldn't find the door. Then when we got inside we loved the decor, loved the cocktails and loved the food. Most of all we loved being served by Ann Marie....We had a good laugh with her.  We enjoyed it that much we booked for the next day and stayed two sittings. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good cocktailMore",5.0
"As a preface, I hope this review does not come across as overly critical - It's a fantastic bar and you're sure to have a good time. That said, I believe it is only right that a venue self-described as ""Dublin's best"" is held to...such a standard.

Lovely decor, ambience, and speakeasy theming - it's worth experiencing at least once for this alone. Great service too, but did not go ""above and beyond"". Missing little touches - For example, room temperature water was left on the table rather than being served to customers. Judging by the candle wax accumulated on the rim of one of the accompanying glasses, I suspect this had been left out from a previously empty 2-hour table sitting.

The cocktail menu itself is certainly extensive, albeit difficult to judge from the small selection that we did try. However, I did find the Tiki menu to be somewhat disappointing. I understand the VCC's desire to innovate and put their own unique spin on some of the classic drinks, but you have to question at which point does such libationary deviance become excessive.

All in all, a very good cocktail bar. By Dublin's standards, it's easily in the top 10%. Is it the one the best? No, but it certainly has the potential. In any case, it's still absolutely worth your visit.

Advice to Mgmt: Consider revising the menu - The narrative flow is excellent, but I think the breadth of selection does in some ways hinder the overall execution. A carefully curated menu, with a touch more appreciation for the authenticity of the more regarded timeless recipes, and you're onto a winner.More",4.0

Did not receive a menu until 25 mins after sitting down, not even a drinks menu until this point as well. Basically ignored till the point where I had to ask for a menu whilst the female waiter had brought in another couple and was giving them menus immediately. 

The starters looked promising on the plate but was lacking in flavour. Whilst waiting for the main my partner glanced over at the the waitress taking another tables order and was snapped at ‚Äúyour food is on the way. Okay‚ÄùWe had not even complained or said anything to her regarding the wait time for the main as we realise it was quite busy. This was made us feel quite awkward.  

When the main did arrive it seemed like it had been sitting there for a while as it was lukewarm. The mushroom rice was below average and was hard.  Burnt garlic was prominent. The mains flavour wise was lacking. Maybe suiting others who do not enjoy spice. 

Overall bad experience.  I understand that it was a busy night and the staff was under pressure but I do not think it should effect the quality of the food.

And guess what, they were allowed straight in and got the table I‚Äôd pointed to 15 minutes ago!!! Just simply unbelievable. I couldn‚Äôt believe what had just happened. We decided to wait a further 5 mins as now 2 tables had cleared up and were being cleaned by staff.

You know what‚Äôs coming next - two more couples got to the front of the queue and said they‚Äôd booked 5 minutes ago (via app/phone call) and were let straight in. 

Excuse me but in what world is this fair??? We‚Äôd waited 20 minutes now for a seat and in that time, you let 1 couple in who were 15 mins late, and you let another 2 couples in who somehow magically booked within the last few minutes we were standing there and they jumped ahead of us in the queue????

We were not extremely hungry the night we came, so we only had the main course.  My husband had the short ribs which were perfectly prepared.  I ordered a striploin steak which, unfortunately, was extremely tough.

"Excellent food and staff in a cozy setting. The St. Stephen Green downtown area is rich with restaurants and coffee shops. 
- Starter: scallops with a piece of fried chicken skin (in lieu of bacon?) were exceptional. 
- mains: butternut squash risotto and roasted hazelnuts...(wow)
- slow cooked beef was excellent, needed more jus or gravy to intensify an already tasty dish. 
- desserts: chocolate tart and orange marmalade cake were award winning. 
- Good strong cappuccino. 
Highly recommended.More",5.0
"Really good, not perfect. Had a couple of work colleagues out for the evening. The staff were very professional, in very nice surroundings. Relaxed, unhurried and friendly.
We had oysters, ham hock croquette and scallops to start. All were very well presented and tasted well...but not exceptional. Temperature was slightly cold.

For mains we had lamb rump which was excellent all round. Also had striploin steak served with a mushroom duxelle which was quite mediocre. Side of baby boiled potatoes was cold and not dressed in any way. 

Would generally recommend but would love the food to be amped up a bit.

"The Hugo restaurant is located near the small old Huguenot Cemetery, perhaps hence the name.  It was very crowded on a Friday night and hence perhaps why service was not good.  Waiter did not write down order - always a bad sign - and side...orders were forgotten.  On this being pointed out to the waiter after some time, the kitchen was busy, i.e. did not admit an error on his part.  Eventually delivered them at the end of the meal.  When I took exception to this an apology was given and we were not charged for the side dish. Still not a good experience.  I suspect that they are simply just trying to drive as much business as possible through the restaurant, even if quality suffers.  Food average.More",3.0

Please take this is a a word of warning on...two fronts. The menu advertised on their website is highly inaccurate. There was a choice of only 4 main courses (not the kebabs etc. advertised as available on a Saturday, the evening we went) and to add to the issue, only were 3 available. A seitan steak, an asparagus risotto and a Mediterranean style pasta. How disappointing, basically no different (with the exception of the steak) to any other restaurant which offers something veggie/vegan. We had the seitan steak which was decent. We had olives to start. I didn't think olives could provide us with disappointment, however, they were evidently out of a jar, and laced in chopped garlic to try and disguise this.¬†

Secondly, it's BYOB (not just alcohol, but any sort of drink which isn't water). I will happily admit if I missed this on the website, but it would be really helpful of this was pointed out somewhere beforehand. Also, at no point was the ‚Ç¨6 corkage for¬† wine advertised anywhere. A bit steep in my book.¬†

An additional problem which seemed to affect everyone in the restaurant was the length of time to serve the food. We waited 1 hour 10mins for our main to arrive, which they did apologise for. At the end the server didn't ask us how the food was, else I would have politely explained rather than having to write this here.

Overall, I cannot recommend this restaurant. Spending money on food should be a fun and pleasant experience and this was neither.¬†More",2.0

It was so bad- pasta was over cooked, and the sauce was flavourless- no hint of salt, garlic or pine nuts‚Ä¶ got salt and pepper which made it a bit better but still was not good.

To pull this off, I felt that the venue and the location had to be 100% perfect.  I had been in Asador's before and recalled that it had a really nice terrace.  The location is adjacent to the city centre but not actually in the centre, easier for those who travelled from further afield.

I set up a meeting with the manager, Drazen, who was incredible to deal with and the reunion went way beyond my expectations.

A cocktail on arrival ensured that the passage of time was no more and the laughter and chitchat flowed.   Asador prides themselves on the quality of their food and the menu was excellent and varied.  Their service was impeccable.

The terrace was the real winner that set the tone of the night,  Its very tastefully designed, complete with private bar and encourages an ease of social interaction which was so important. The terrace has heaters and windows which were opened which also made it very safe from a covid and health perspective.  As we dined on the terrace, proof of vaccination was not required  tho the main restaurant did.

The reunion went so well that we are discussing having a reunion of the reunion .. where else but Asador and the terrace of course!

"Having visited the Vermillion many times in the past, I was really looking forward to going for dinner this time. However, the whole experience was extremely dissatisfying, and I am sorry to say- I will not visit again. As a group, we eat Indian food...very regularly and don't mind paying a little more for quality food and an enjoyable dining experience. Vermillion used to be a little pricer than average, but for top quality food. 

On this occasion, out of a table of 5 of us, only one person enjoyed their meal. I paid 17 euro for a small vegetarian curry, followed by an additional 4 euro for rice. That is a total of 21 euro for mediocre rice and vegetables. Others paid 25 euro for a curry with chicken. 

One curry was left virtually untouched, and the waiting staff didn't ask if anything was wrong, or why the food had not been eaten. In contrast, we felt almost hounded by the waiting staff when it came to ordering desserts, as they came over repeatedly in a short space of time, after we had requested a few minutes to let our dinner go down. Everyone in the group felt irritated by these interactions, and after asking for a few minutes on a second occassion, the server was quite abrupt, which left us wondering if there was time limit that we hadn't been informed of. 

I'm very disappointed to write this review, as Vermillion is somewhere we had been fond of in the past. But things seem to have gone terribly downhill in both the kitchen and floor staff and with the extortionate prices- we will not be back.More",2.0

Drinks got recommended to us...and tastey very good. The food came out shortly after.  The french fries could have had a little more salt on them though.

Highlight of the restaurant must be the big bar in the middle. It is beautifully made and looks great! Only thing that bothered us was all the red light being used in the front of the restaurant where we were sitting. Maybe that could be toned down a little.
Otherwise it was a lovely evening - thank you.More",4.0

"I walked into the restaurant at around 7:30pm after a long day, because I happened to be around the area. I was looking for a familiar quick dinner before heading to my hotel, and was sadly disappointed. The staff was nice and friendly, but that...was all that was good. The menu is quite small, and does not have some of the items I am used to finding in TGI's in other places. When the food came, it was average at best - I had the larger sized sirloin and asked for it medium, but the fact is that it was so thin that there was really no way to make it medium. The margarita was watery. But worse of all is that they placed us close to a table that was apparently having a birthday party, but they were so loud I couldn't hear my own thoughts. I mentioned it to the server, which offered me to move to one table further, which would have made no difference. When I was leaving, I noticed many empty tables towards the front of the restaurant, which would have been much better. I understand that a large table is good for the restaurant, but when one of the servers cam hugging people, obviously friends with people at the table, I kinda felt they were the only ones the restaurant cared about. It was very disappointing, as I would have loved to have a couple more drinks, but I finished my plate as fast as I could and ran away.More",2.0

The prices are more than back home but it is hardly the fault of the businesses here that the pound is weak against the Euro.
If you want to have great time in Dublin visit Murray's and if it not your cup of tea then it has a whiskey and sports bar upstairs and downstairs.

"I have always loved the Ginger man and the atmosphere but unfortunately it has changed over the last couple of months. 
I have had a couple of unfortunately episodes there over the last couple months with everything from unwelcoming staff, forgotten orders etc but we...all need to get a chance after starting again after the pandemic.. 
But this evening was just too weird. We couldn‚Äôt be served in the bar even when it was our turn after standing in line like everyone else. The bartender kept on asking people behind us. Afterwards we ordered food sitting at a table inside and they asked us to pay for the food before it was served. We thought it was a misunderstanding so we asked for the food first. One waiter came down to ask for the payment in the beginning of the meal and then another waiter asked again 5 minutes later. All the other tables were served with food around us at the same time and none of the other tables with Irish people had to pay before eating their food. It made me so sad because I didn‚Äôt understand what was wrong and the staff couldn‚Äôt explain it to us. 
I hope it will change and go back to how it was before again. You still have great hot wings but it is just not everything.More",1.0

"To stay at the Shelbourne is to enjoy a style of life that only the rich and famous can afford.  We left the Staycity Dublin Castle for a night at the Shelbourne and it was well worth it.  We came to England on the QM2...in Queens Grill and got spoiled there.  Then a Marriott Residence Inn in London and the Staycity in Dublin.  After 3 nights there we needed to end out trip with some luxury and luckily the Shelbourne was available! A king bed with balcony room was just what we needed.  The bellman brought up our bags to the welcoming and grand room. The bed divine and just exuding a luxury feel. Next was a lunch in the Saddle Room, Daube of beef with carrot and green bean sides, exceptional and it should be for the prices you pay for your extravagance.  For us, it was well worth it after the bare bones Staycity. We had afternoon tea and while also quite pricey at $55 Euros per person the staff were wonderful and since we had ours at 5:00pm it became dinner.  The staff even wrapped our leftover treats to enjoy later in our room.  Only disappointments were the Horseshoe Bar being closed for a private corporate event and the continental breakfast for $25 Euros per person.  For what you get $15 Euros should be charged.  But once you are sitting with your Shelbourne robe wrapped around you your room you just fall into the feeling that you deserve this and will think about the bills later.

There is an attached pub which didn't appear to serve food too.

Although very tempted by ordering the corned beef, we settled on the 12oz sirloin steak, with mashed potatoes (with scallions) and mushrooms.  It was very good, and a large enough portion that we shared it and were both full.  Along with a pint of local beer it made a great final night in Dublin.

While we were eating we both siad we would love to take Anna home with us.  She is the most efficient and friendly waiting staff member I have ever met.  The bar was spotless and there was a lovely friendly, homely atmosphere.  It was full for lunch but never felt like anyone else was on top of me.  We were that impressed with the whole experience that we returned again today, the food was just as good again.  We will also be back again next Tuesday.  We rarely have the same day off so it was nice to have quality time with my friend with quality food and quality staff.

After 3 or so calls we finally get through and they said they'll be right with us. 20 minutes later there's no sign of them so we ring again, again we have to call multiple times because they don't like picking up the phone. When they finally answer they maker up the flimsy excuse that they only put the food on after the person arrives as they've been ""burned before"", the statement that they gave is a lie as when we ordered from them last year we were waiting less than 5 minutes before our food got to us.

"I've visited the Brock many times over the years and to be honest today was the last straw. The service has gone to pot & it's not from the lack of staff let's be honest. I've tolerated this for a good while now but no...more. 

I arrived to find a small queue formed outside the door but yet plenty of seats available. When I did get seated, there was no contact tracing details been taken (or from anyone when I was there) nor was there any hand sanitiser on the tables outside. The customer immediately behind me had sat, eaten and left before I got served even though we both ordered at the same time. That being said the customer more than likely got a breakfast intended for someone else as it was out in less than 5 minutes. When you start to see people getting breakfast / service having arrived later it's fairly bad. Then when I made it known that I was waiting for breakfast, service came quick after that... but it's as clear as day to me that I was forgotten about. I quickly ate my food, paid and left. Whilst I was there, people were left waiting in the heat outside despite there being a good few available seats. It's not exactly hard to allocate one staff member to do these tasks nor is breakfast service exactly rocket science when most breakfast items can be prepped well in advance. 

Aside of the service issues, I'm not even sure where the Brock has got this reputation for good food as from what I've seen over the last number of years, it's fairly average with above average pricing for what's on offer. As I've said, today was the last straw and to be honest it probably will be the last time I'll consider the Brock for food.More",2.0

Today we had the specials - Corned...beef for my wife and Ray wings fried in butter and finished with capers for me. Two fine simple meals cooked to perfection and presented with smile. They were followed by a ‚Äòwicked‚Äô Tiramasu that should have had a health warning it was so rich 

This pub gives of the best in a manner that charms and it does it every time.

"I love this pub and have been going for many years. I recently was in Finnegans Of Dalkey for a few drinks with some mates and I was sat at the bar counter for a few hours enjoying my evening pints. Picture this, the nice...wooden bar top with the normal view of the row of taps for beer, the shelves with spirits, the mixers, the glasses, the bucket of ice for gin and tonics etc and a bucket of ice for the chilling of the white wine bottles‚Ä¶ ah, how nice‚Ä¶.. . Scrub that. What I saw was the above however the white wine bottles, yes the probably not so clean ones out of the cardboard boxes, cellars, warehouses, etc, the ones that are handled by numerous staff members ( the good staff who handle card machines, cash, bins, dirty glasses etc ) are being left in the ice bucket that peoples gin and tonics etc ice is being sourced from.

"Having come over from the UK to begin a work project for six months, I was given a place to stay in Dalkey for the duration. I quickly checked out the pubs in the village and soon found Finnegan's to be perfect for me. 

Donal...and Alan know how to run a good pub - that was instantly clear,.....and along with Damien, Ken and the rest of the staff, my colleagues and I were made to feel like locals.

In an affluent (some would say, 'posh') place such as Dalkey, it is refreshing to find the down-to-earth attitude and vibe that Finnegan's offers. The Guinness is top notch, the food is grand and the service is spot on - I thoroughly recommend.More",5.0

"This was a significant birthday celebration and was the first time our family had been together since the 2020 lockdown due to the Covid- 19 pandemic.

From the beginning we had difficulty as the time allotted for lunch was too short for this kind of...celebration so we opted for an early dinner instead to give us time to spend together. We were told we had to be out by 7.45pm so they reluctantly agreed to let us be there at 4.45pm for a drink.

We booked a private room for 12 people and were assigned the Gold Room.
After a deposit was paid, they came back and said we had to be out by 6.45pm! At this stage we should have cancelled but the deposit was paid.

We arrived and were shown to what I would call a private area, you couldn‚Äôt call it a room as most of one wall was missing, it was just at the waiter‚Äôs station, the table was so big you couldn‚Äôt move around to speak to the other people and every time a waiter came in my husband‚Äôs chair was buffeted. The staff were friendly but not very welcoming or warm.
It was only when I checked the website after our visit, that I realised we had not been given The Gold Room as was booked.

We ordered and after some time I eventually asked if we could have some wine so they brought a wine menu! 

The starters came and everyone agreed they were delicious if very small. Our main courses arrived and I sat looking at mine in disbelief.
I had ordered the belly of pork, what I was served were two thin pieces about 5cm x 7cm with 2/3 white fat and 1/3 meat. I was expecting it to be slow roasted so that all the fat would be rendered out and the meat succulent. I actually had to eat the fat the pieces were so small.
My sister and brother-in-law ordered beef and got a good substantial amount but paid ‚Ç¨15 each extra for it.
We had to ask for more sides.

Even though we had informed the restaurant that two of us needed Gluten Free meals there was only one dessert that we could have besides the cheese board and that was a Rice Pudding which was the most ordinary dessert that I have had in a very long time.

We weren‚Äôt offered tea or coffee as they wanted us out as soon as possible.
We ended up, all 12 of us, on the footpath outside the restaurant trying to have a chat as the room was not conducive to having a conversation as we would have had to shout and there was no-where in the immediate vicinity that we could convene to.

I had checked the 10 Best Restaurants in Dublin list and had picked out Locks as it was the only one which was recommended to me by a friend and the menu looked interesting.

We spent a lot of money that day and looking back I just feel used.

It certainly wasn‚Äôt the 60th birthday celebration with my family I had expected.More",1.0

"Everything about this spot is amazing. We were a party of five celebrating a big birthday and we had a very enjoyable evening.  The Guinness and sourdough breads were very tasty. The BBQ asparagus and torched mackerel starters were delicious. We followed with Donegal cod,...a potato flan and 60-day aged sirloin of beef for mains and all were excellent. We had a Portuguese red wine - Quinta de Cidr√¥ (Touriga Nacional ‚Äì apparently a grape unique to Portugal) ‚Äì try this wine when you visit ‚Äì it is superb.

"Surely one of the finest ways to treat yourself is lunchtime at Locks Restaurant overlooking the Grand Canal.  As a party of four we celebrated new beginnings for a colleague last Saturday. It was described by our guest as a real treat and a fabulous...experience. We arrived for a 12-30pm lunch and were greeted warmly and allowed settle and not felt rushed, before our order was taken.  Be tempted and select from the small plates. They are a perfect statement of what Lock‚Äôs under its new chef is all about. Fresh, local, food prepared with detail. Ocean fresh oyster with house kimchi; delicate ox tongue on mini, light as air waffles, treacle brown bread with Locks own made cultured butter.
I have yet to taste a starter of perfectly prepared scallops as from this menu. Castletownbere scallops and smoked sea urchin were perfectly balanced with texture, freshness and flavour. We crossed the menu from rabbit to cod with smoked eel, beautifully presented and delicately flavoured gnocchi with celeriac. A side of charred sprouting broccoli with roasted hazelnut miso was new twist on an old favourite. Wonderful texture and flavour.
Two of us opted for the local cheese board presented with a light florid wild honey, and delicate fennel crackers. The cheese selection was well varied and an ideal portion to round off a perfect afternoon.

"There‚Äôs been a lot of talk about Locks, in Portobello. Had lunch there recently, group menu. Good staff, well appointed room, limited, but still interesting menu. Until the food showed up, that is. Venison tartare, could have been any meat. No discernible taste of, well,...anything. Scallops, however, were nice enough. The mains, pork belly, cod and beef. 
Pork was very ordinary, nicely presented, but not particularly nice. Cod was good, served with a chickeny jus. Beef rib eye, only available for two and with a  ‚Ç¨30 supplement!, was at best fffine. And fffine is really no where near good enough to justify that price. Vegetable were overdone. Might have been nice otherwise. 
Dessert were good, but, why is there a supplement charged for those few crumbs of cheese. 
Locks charge a high price for what is, at best, medium quality fare.More",2.0
"I was looking forward to a return visit to locks as this was to be my first visit under a new head chef, well it did not disappoint. From the start, the small plates to nibble on prior to our meal set the tone for...our Sunday Lunch. The Guinness and Treacle brown bread was unmatched and the Locks Waffle with ox tongue and pickled mushroom was a delicious combination. I had the Cured Sea trout as a starter which was dressed with a brown crab emulsion making it a culinary delight, but the most impressive was my Monkfish which was cooked to perfection with a subtle addition of smoked eel keeping the dish simple to allow the flavours complement each other.
The food presentation was of the highest standard and the view overlooking the canal just added to a wonderful experience. Can't wait to return.More",5.0
"Yes, I've reviewed locks before and it remains as reliably excellent as it has been for some years.  The  excellent cooking is complemented by really nice service, attentive though relaxed and unfussy. The emphasis is on the right things.

The highlight, however, had to be the Delmonico steak for 2 which two hungry men shared and devoured with satisfaction. Our companions both opted for the cod which as equally good. The starters were sublime, an explosion of taste, imagination and sumptuousness. Be warned, though, the menu is short with only 4 choices for mains. But they‚Äôll get there. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.

We were very pleasantly surprised by the very high quality of the food...loved the monkfish.   The service up on the mezzanine was exceptional, attentive without being intrusive.  The crowd was pretty loud, or it may have been our location up near the curved ceiling that captured the sound.  It wasn't a problem for us, but people looking for a quite dinner might visit before evening really kicks in.More",5.0
Loved the interior of this restaurant.  Good service and friendly staff.  Food was good but nothing fabulous.  It was a bit loud but we were on the upper level so the bottom floor may have been better.  Great fun vibe.,4.0
"Popped in during a visit to Dublin. Decor is superb. Staff very welcoming and friendly. We only had a drink, but the restaurant looked very appealing and the menu was comprehensive. Smells wafting from the food going past on trays were very tempting and the...plates looked laden with very generous portions for very reasonable prices. One street up from the river in Temple Bar district. Strongly recommend it.More",5.0
"This place is busy and loud but serves excellent food. We sat in the balcony area and it was wonderful. Our server couldn‚Äôt have been more attentive, knowledgable and kind. Food was very good and there was a wide variety to suit all our tastes....Our American tastebuds were craving a side salad (hard to find in Ireland?!) and while they didn‚Äôt have one on the menu they made it anyways. for us. Definitely need reservations. Great location near Trinity College and Temple Bar area.More",5.0
"The Bank is a beautiful specimen of a restaurant. It's busy on any evening of the week, so make a reservation if you can, or you'll easily have a long wait. It's so visually stunning, you'll want to stay all evening. We had a drink...at the bar while waiting for our table, and the bartenders were fantastic.  Our waitress was sweet, but the service was slow because they were slammed. The chowder was great (the brown bread that accompanied it was terrible). The pate was solid. The entrees of pork chops and monk fish were marginal at best- I'd skip them and stick with drinks and appetizers.More",4.0
"Saw this restaurant and had to get a quick breakfast before seeing the Book of Kells. I ordered a Mini Irish. Great price and good amount of food. I would order it again in the future. The food is locally sourced and very fresh. Excellent...flavors in the meats. Eggs were cooked to perfection. Bread had s good texture. If you are wandering about City Centre's area near Trinity College, this restaurant is well worth a visit. They also have museum features that are worth investigating. I would highly recommend this location!More",5.0
"We came here on a Saturday for lunch.  We were first struck by the interior.  It is stunning.  We were seated right away.  I ordered the seafood chowder which came with brown bread.  It is enough for a lunch by itself.  Chock full of seafood....My husband ordered the fish and chips.  He enjoyed it.  Our server was Terrific.  The only bad moment was when my husband tried using the water closet on the 2nd floor where we were seated.  It was occupied for a long time, so he took the stairs down to the basement water closet.  Upon arriving back to our floor he was lectured by a rude server that the staircase was for use by staff only.  She asked him if he were seated on the floor, and he replied to her that our table was right behind her.  She was very rude.  Otherwise a great experience.More",5.0

"I have eaten great food around the world and tried many different cuisines. However, Dublin, being the beautiful melting pot of great minds and people, also continues to seem to surpass itself with a variety of great eating places.
We stumbled across The Bank on...the way to finding Temple Bar. It looks very imposing, but don't let that put you off!
Once up the steps and inside, you are shown to a table - upstairs or downstairs - it doesn't matter, the ambience is wonderful. 
Some say the menu is a little limited...well maybe so, but what you get is sublime. It was so good [we were only in Dublin for 2 days] we went back the second day...Why?
The Steak and Guinness Pie. I am a great lover of pies...on the first day my wife had the pie and I had the Dingle Bay Fish and chips - superb, light crispy batter, beautiful chips, served with stylish peas and home made tartare.
I absolutely loved it! 
I tasted my wife's pie and Oh My Word!! What flavour and quality of beef, just astonishing.
We came back the second day and BOTH had the pie! No question. 
We also had a lovely range of drinks - great Guinness of course, but a nice selection of both wines [reasonable] and  a range of cocktails.
We also shared [because we couldn't manage one each - and I am a fair eater!!!] one of their signature brownies - to die for !!
Bill just under 65 Euros which was so worth it!
I have to mention our waitress, who was so good, very quick and caring and a delight to talk to. [She also remembered us on the second day and went out of her way to do her best]

As we are always up for good Asian food, we decided to try it out.

There are two options, one being the classic ""√† la carte"" and the other, the...""5-course sharing menu"", for 79 Euros / person. We opted for the ""sharing menu"", so we could taste some more options.
For all the courses, except the ""salad"" one, each of us was able to get a different dish.  So, over the 10 courses between us two, we got 9 different dishes.

Taste Restaurant is located in a beautiful building on...the top floor in the heart of Dublin. The server was so full of knowledge about each dish that we entrusted her to order for us! Each dish was so intricate and different from the last. It was like a 'sitting down adventure.' The table was cleared after each dish and we were given a different set of 'tools' depending on the dish and then we were instructed by the waiter how to eat it best. The staff were so professional and seemed really happy to be there. Great atmosphere!

The waitress was really helpful at guiding...us through the menu as it was all very new to us. We wanted to try everything but thankfully she stopped us from ordering too much and we ended with just the right amount of food. We shared some nigiri and crisp makis to start and some chicken. Everything was very tasty, especially the seabream and crab broth. Will definitely be back when I'm next in town.More",5.0
"This was one of the worst dining experiences in a long time. The menu was completely confusing and misleading. Whatever we ordered was questioned by the waitress. We wanted to share a nigiri platter as a starter, she tried to get us to get 2....When we said we wanted only 1 as we had planned to order several other things she told us ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you want some Maki too then, salmon or tuna?‚Äù 
We never said we wanted to order Maki and felt incredibly pressured. My friend said she wanted battered broccoli, to which the waitress said: ‚Äúok, but have you seen the chicken?‚Äù
At that point we told her that this is the 3rd time she‚Äôs trying to pressure us into getting something we didn‚Äôt ask for and that we were perfectly able to read the menu and didn‚Äôt want any chicken! 
She later proceeded to park her butt on our table while taking the order from the people next to us. Worst waitress I‚Äôve ever seen. 
The food was grand, but not amazing and did in no way justify the price. It was all about the presentation. It was nowhere near as good as the sushi in Yamamori right across the road, and 3 times more expensive.More",1.0
"We went here to try the tasting menu, having read so many good reviews.  The tasting menu was 79 euro a head, and we opted for the wine pairing too at 50 euro a head.

Wine review first - they were all fine, nothing bad...to say about any, none of them stood out,  the champagne at the beginning of the meal was very tasty.

The tasting menu -  The amuse bouche was superb and we both looked at each other and said 'this is a great start' but unfortunately it went downhill from there.  

There was nothing wrong with any of the dishes served but there nothing memorable or nothing exceptional either.  For 79 euro a head you would expect something to have been a little bit special (especially if you consider you can have a 4 course mean in Chapter One for 80 euro).

The restaurant itself looks great, with a good atmosphere etc but the food was a let down.  If the bill had come in at half the price it would have been an 'ok' meal but at the price it was I would not go back and would recommend against visiting here.

There are better Sushi options in Dublin but unfortunatley many of those places are pretty casual, so if you are looking for fine dining it can be hard to get any type of Sushi (never mind great sushi).

Only issues was that our waitress mistakenly gave us Prosecco  and admitted it was by mistake but included it on our bill.  There may have been a miscommunication but it was her mistake and she presented as if it was to our advantage but it still appeared on the bill.

Good wine list - some decent prices and some less so but a little navigating came up with a very nice Chianti Trambusti.

The wine we had for that price was average.A glass of non alcoholic wine was 14 euros. Ridiculous. We were charged 81 euro service charge. I queried this and it was a mistake. Tables of 6 or more pay 12.5%. Ridiculous. So a table of 5 pays none. I was offered 26 euro for the over charging. I had to point out this was still incorrect. So I was offered another 10. I took it but was still 50 cent out. I didn‚Äôt like the attitude of the manager. I‚Äôm sorry but I won‚Äôt be returning. There are better places to eat in this area and in Dublin in general for less money.More,2.0
I have no idea how it was so quite . The food was so good. We had looked at the menu and didn‚Äôt get passed the starters as they all sounded so tasty . We ordered with lots of sides . Everything was perfect ....The terrine was so soft and seasoned so well . And to top it off it was  so reasonable .More,5.0
"We had the place to ourselves at 17:30, Wednesday evening.
We both had the strip loin steak. It was excellent. The Bernaise sauce was perfect and plentiful.
Great chips and fabulous onion rings.
All the staff were excellent, though one waitress was a bit overpowering...and condescending, we thought.
I don‚Äôt appreciate being called ‚Äúdarling‚Äù and ‚Äúdear‚Äù by strangers.More",4.0
Was at the old spot by coincidence for lunch - had the best potato salad ever to go along with a fantastic salt water salmon- absolutely incredible! But it has been their potato salad which really has been engraved into memory! Go there and experience...the best (pub) food of Dublin - btw - they have very nice people looking after you. Absolutely worth a visit!More,5.0
"Thanks to some very nice people in the TripAdvisor forums I learned about The Old Spot. Our reservation was on a Sunday so we were able order the roast sirloin of beef. It was great. The meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare.. I have...not had yorkshire pudding in years and while it was not as good as my mom use to make, it was still delicious. The cauliflower cheese was so yummy. It reminded me of mac-n-cheese. Of course the potatoes were equally good. I don't ear beans and carrots but my husband said they were very good. My husband enjoyed our dinner so much that we returned a 2nd time. This time we had burgers. Again our meal was great. On our 2nd visit we were helped by Natalie. She was super nice and friendly. If we are ever fortunate enough to return to Dublin we will go back. 
By the way don't even think of going there on a Sunday without a reservation. It is super busy.More",5.0
"Came to the old spot for Sunday Lunch and was absolutely blown away by the quality of the food and service. 
We were served by Natalie who was extremely attentive, really friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome.

We had the ham croquette...and the asparagus soup to start, both were really delicious and the homemade brown sauce was brilliant with the croquettes. 

For lunch we both had the roast sirloin which was cooked impeccably, pink edge to edge and generous serving of meat. The duck fat potatoes were crispy and fluffy inside, the cauliflower cheese was lovely and the carrots were cooked with star anise which gave them a lovely flavour that really complimented the rest of the meal. 

We had hoped to have dessert after but were too full to order! However, when Natalie was chatting to us we mentioned it had been my birthday the week previous and she organised a tiramisu dessert with a candle for us  to share which was absolutely lovely and very thoughtful.

We had strawberry and basil daiquiris and a Tully n‚Äô apple and all of the drinks that came were really good.

Could see how well the staff team worked together and everything was so smooth and the service was really 5 star.

"I went here on a whim and right off the vibe was a bit and I should have trusted my gut instinct and left but I opted to give them a chance. They have a pretty limited drinks and food menu. I ordered hot tea...and cup had a lipstick stain, YUCK! I told the waiter who seemed mad that I had pointed this out but he took it back and brought me out a new pot of tea and cup. I cleaned it with my own disinfectant. I ordered the beef stew which was really just over salted cloddy meat and vegetables. Only flavor I could taste was salt so I after a couple of spoonfuls I could not stomach anymore of it. The waiter was not warm or welcoming and he asked the party that was next to me, twice, how their meal was coming but never asked me. I looked around and I was the only person of color in the restaurant. I paid for my meal and requested to speak with the manager to provide my experience feedback, BIG MISTAKE! She was just as bad in her behavior as the waiter, if not worse. I explained my negative experience factually and mentioned that it seemed I was not accorded the same service as those around me maybe because I complained about the lipstick stained cup or because I was black. When I said this she immediately cocked her head back and burst out laughing like I had been telling a joke all whilst grabbing my shoulder. I was taken aback and immediately told her not to touch me. Her demeanor changed and was borderline demonic like how dare I tell her not to touch me! I stood my ground and she said there is no way I was treated this way because, ""WE HAVE A BLACK FELLA WHO WASHES OUR DISHES!!!"" I kid you not this was her excuse for the horrible service I received. I just was not going to engage with her any further and proceeded to leave upon which she uttered some words in Irish to me but I just kept going. I would not recommend this place to anyone as the food was horrible and the service even worse, especially people of color!More",1.0

It was late afternoon, and there weren't that many customers.  A few tourists and it...seems to be very family friendly.  There were more children with their parents seated around than just adults.  Mercifully, the children were well behaved and quiet!  The only downside was the smell of food and that general stale sort of smell you get in many pubs in Ireland when you first walk in.  One remarkable thing are the drink prices - a pint of Hop House 13 and a Bacardi and Diet Coke cost ‚Ç¨16.70 - which was ‚Ç¨0.50 dearer than the same round in the Gresham's Writer's Lounge next door!  And in terms of opulence, there is no comparison between the two venues!More",3.0

"I never leave bad reviews, but I feel I had to point this out. First of all, when I walked up, I was told (not asked) to get in line behind a couple that was ahead of me. Bear in mind the only people that...were outside the restaurant waiting on a table were my partner and me, and another couple, so there was no way I could have skipped the queue as per the waitress's comment.  When a table became available, we were brought to our table by another polite team member. As we were about to sit down, this particular waitress shouted out of nowhere that our table needed to be sanitised to step back. That‚Äôs not the way customers should be treated when arriving to have breakfast on Sunday morning.More",2.0

"I came to Paulie's with 4 friends a few Sundays ago and had a fantastic experience. 

We had no booking and it seemed like they had plenty of reservations that evening, but they were happy to give us a table for an hour. The place...is small and intimate and oozes authenticity. It is also conveniently located an approx 20-minute walk from the 3 arena and a 10-minute walk from the Aviva stadium. 

There is plenty of choice on the menu, and an array of exciting specials were displayed on a chalkboard behind us. We watched our food being made from scratch and placed into a clay oven right before our eyes. Within 15 minutes of ordering, we were all served some of the best pizzas I'd ever seen and tasted.  

All staff were attentive and incredibly friendly. Around 20 minutes after we had left, I realised that I had left an envelope with concert tickets inside on my table. I rang the restaurant, and they immediately began to search for them as I made my way back. When I arrived, the manager was sifting through a bin in the unlikely case that one of the staff threw them out while cleaning our table. Luckily I found them, and the staff seemed as relieved as I was that they had been retrieved. 

I will definitely return to Paulie's the next time I'm in the area. I would strongly recommend trying out this place if you want to experience an authentic, family-run pizzeria in Dublin.More",5.0

"Visited with my sister and her friend. When we arrived our table wasn‚Äôt ready, but we‚Äôre told, they will be paying so it shouldn‚Äôt be long. We could wait at the bar. We were brought upstairs. Said bar, was covered in dirty glasses and service...ware so clearly not intended for anyone to sit at. We stood there awkwardly as they cleared everything away while the barmen tutted away to each other. 
We ordered drinks and sat down. We then kept having to move so that they could pull pints from a mini keg that was sitting on the tiny bar. Then they asked my friend to get up so they could change the keg, which proceeded to be problematic so she had to stand there for ages while they sorted that.  Not a word of apologies. We had to enquire numerous times Shakir our table. Eventually 45 mins after our booking time (I wish I was exaggerating) the host said, I‚Äôve found you another table. (What happened to our acutely table) and then shoved in the corner upstairs. 
He did the day to my sister , I‚Äôll look after you now and I think there was a brief apology. 
At the table, we had to ask for menus, ask to order. The place is busy, we know it is, but it just was really slow service. 
Thankfully the food was great. 
When the bill came-  there was no ‚Äòlooking after us‚Äô. Not even the drinks we had at the bar were covered while we waited 45 mins for our reserved table. 
No apologies when we were leaving. Just blank looking faces.

However, having been to the 101 on a few occasions many years before Covid and lockdown, sad to note the place has certainly didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe Friday or Saturday evening is not good time to visit - just before curtain call at the Abbey nearby. We decided on the same main dish each - featherblade of beef served with mash and veg. The beef was cooked ok but appeared as if it had been left under heated lamps for too long- dark brown colour and soaked in very rich sauce. Neither of us finished the meal - and were it not for a nice bottle of Chaniti to get rid of taste of the beef, it would have been a total disaster. Overall not a very good dining experience - the restaurant was packed to capacity and the noise levels were literally through the roof - I felt sorry for the staff members, over-worked and under staffed on the evening. Didn't appreciate being asked about leaving tip on the card - that should be at the discretion of diners I thought. Definitely will not return there again.More",2.0

"Just visited here recently with my partner on her recommendation for dinner . Overall food and service was good. I don't claim to be Greek although I've been lucky enough to have been to Greece many times , Mainly on the islands , so I...know a good bit about Greek food.

There was nothing wrong with the quality or the presentation of the food from what we had or what I saw around me .  We had Calamari and the Dips to start. the dips came with a flatbread and as we shared with the size of the dips there wasn't enough bread but asking the waitress sorted that out . Both were lovely.
we both had the chicken and pork Gyros . Lovely and very tasty.

I had a look at the wine list and was amazed to see bottles of wine from Chile , Spain etc on there . Small bit of the wine menu at the top for glass, carafe Greek wine. When I go to a Greek Restaurant I expect to see bottles of Greek wine on it .  A bottle of Robola at least. Look I know its not easy ( but its not impossible ) to get Greek wine in Ireland. Most big stockists have it. Even as a wine of the month in a red , white and Rose. That has to be pushed. 

Two top tables are tiny and the menu could do with a bit of updating . Also if there was Greek music playing in the background I couldn't hear it , The restaurant has the appearance and the murals of a Greek Taverna but it needs to feel like it more. I don't mean plate smashing or Zorba the Greek type music ( Traditional would be nice) but I think the menu could be updated to include grilled sardines, traditional  dolmades made with lamb , homemade pastitsio , grilled swordfish , spanakopita, chicken and pork souvlaki  just to name a few.  Instead of homemade chips , offer a Greek salad on the side .

These ideas are what elevates you above the others. Show off traditional foods and wines and brings you from an good experience to above that.

I may go back.More",3.0

We went there since it was close to our hotel for lunch. It was our first time trying Mongolian food or this kind of cooking. We were greeted by a very polite gentleman that I guess was the manager that helped us with the sitting....The service in general was very good and everyone was polite and helpful even though they had to deal with a clueless couple lol. They have tw options one with a single serve called the Bowl and one with an ''all you can eat''. Both are reasonably priced. We chose the first one and in my opinion it was enough for us. We were satisfied with the food and the freshness of it. A place we highly recommend since it's both tasty and cheap!!!!More,5.0
"My husband and I visited this establishment during our trip to Dublin. It proved a warm welcome of a restaurant - especially in the context of soaring Dublin prices at present. We enjoyed two overstuffed lunch bowls (served with a large side of rice) and...a total of three drinks and the bill came to around 30 euros. A helpful hint would be to have an early dinner/late lunch at this restaurant prior to 4:30pm as the food selection is the same as the evening menu but rated at a lower cost. The standard and range of food was also great. The options enable you to completely personalise your meal. I created a red Thai curry with seafood and my husband created a beef Madras curry which were both beautiful. Finally, the service was good - staff were attentive, fast and helpful. Overall, a must eat in Dublin.More",5.0

"What a fabulous little restaurant to stumble across and really reasonably priced for an all you can eat.  We sat down and the lovely waitress explained what we had to do.  In simple terms.  Get a bowl and walk round a counter filling it with...meat and veg (or just veg) and noodles if you wanted them.  Then on the wall they had a big spice rack with spices you could choose any.  Then over to the sauce counter.  They had BBQ, Teriyaki, Chilli and loads more.  Once you had what you wanted you gave your bowl to the chef and watched him cook it for you. and you can go back as many times as you like.  The idea is to just do small bowls so you can try different flavours.  It was a really nice dining experience and were not rushed to finish.  We will definitely be back again.More",5.0
"We passed this place while out a on a nighttime walking tour and it smelled amazing from outside.

After the tour we made our way back here for dinner, we were a large party of 9, staff were very accommodating getting us a table, we...only had to wait a few minutes. 

‚Ç¨20 all you can eat Mongolian BBQ. The food was good, a good selection of vegetables, sauces and toppings. However it‚Äôs not like previous Mongolian BBQs I‚Äôve visited., The meat selection was only chicken, marinated chicken, pork or a mixture of fish with squid. 

Foods cooked fresh while you wait. 

Everyone enjoyed the food, we were all mostly full after one large bowl so didn‚Äôt take advantage of the all you can eat, ended up paying ‚Ç¨20 for a bowl of stir fry.
