3.0,"Ordered the CONN burger and it was lovely! The beef was slightly peppered and salted. The bacon wasn‚Äôt as crispy as I would have liked but it tasted fresh. The smoked cheese added a nice strong kick. The sweet corn was such a lovely addition and gave each bite just the right tang! The coleslaw was drowning in its own sauce and to be honest, that‚Äôs disgusting! The onion rings were way too oily! The beetroot and goat cheese salad was fantastic!"
3.0,"There are many burgers to choose from on the menu.The wife choose the cheese burger, I The Dubliner, while the children had cheese burgers from the kids menu. Quick, tasty and complimentary ice cream to go, went down well.The children were very happy. Great music.But I was not that excited. Probably need a few beers and onion rings to get the full experience.... Otherwise it is not that far up the burger evolutionary chain."
5.0,"Absolutely loved it here. The service is great and the people are lovely. I was greeted by Kristi who was so welcoming. We got a voucher on groupon which was ‚Ç¨20 for two burgers and sides. I got the Humpty Dumpty which was the biggest burger I've ever eaten, it was delicious, not too beefy like most burger places. Lots of toppings including the normal salad options plus bacon and a fried egg. It was so filling ~ in a good happy way! For sides we got the half and half onion rings and chunky chips which were tasty and a small portion of BBQ wings which were soft and tasty, one of the nicest BBQ sauces I've had on wings in a long time! Overall a greta experience and a tasty meal!"
5.0,"Best burger restaurant in town ! Big, juicy ,great value & great location! Friendly service, relaxed atmosphere with fantastic music! üçªüëçüòÉ"
5.0,We went last week but forgot to upload photos. Lovely lovely lovely! Simple and always exactly what you ask for. the goujons are a little on the greasy side but that's expected. Great service also
5.0,"Enticing spot in the great location of temple bar. Came here with my girlfriend under her recondition and really loved it. They have a special deal where it is ‚Ç¨10 for any burger on the menu with chips and a soft drink. At this price you would expect the serving size to be small but in fact it is the totally opposite, I got the Mexican burger which on its own is ‚Ç¨13 but is still included in the ‚Ç¨10 deal and it was massive and extremely tasty with so many different flavours all wrapped into one. Probably one of the best burgers I've had in a long time especially for that price. One other massive bonus is that you also get a free 99 ice-cream if you order before 6 which really...read more"
4.0,"Burger is a burger is a burger until you go to Bobos. Inundated with offers and choices I had the humpty dumpty burger and her ladyship Edwina Love had a veggie burger but opted for the healthy lettuce ""bun"". Too many times in other places the burger itself has just been a carrier for the toppings but the patty itself here is full of flavour and cooked to perfection. Great range of starters and sides that we will be back to sample, prices are great and the service is prompt and the atmosphere is chilled with good background music."
5.0,"Fantastic! We haven't found another burger joint in Ireland as close to our American burgers as this! If you are craving a great burger, this is your place!"
4.5,Great burgers the rest is not the best in the world. it is what it is and what I expected well worth a visit if you like a proper burger. Staff are great too
4.0,"This was my first time here so I wasn't too sure what to expect, one look at the menu and I knew I was going to be in trouble - there was about 6 or 7 burgers I wanted to try (which will mean I'll come back at least 6 or 7 times!) but narrowed it down to the Veggie Dame which combined yummy falafel and all the good fresh things such as lettuce, beef tomato, onions, creme fraiche and tzatziki. Oh my god so good! The huge (and very sturdy) burger came with chubby chips and a bottle of water for ‚Ç¨10. Bargain! Perfect for a quick but substantial and filling bite! Shout out to the staff who were so lovely too."
3.5,"I came here for dinner last night (courtesy of a very kind voucher from Zomato) and got exactly what I wanted after a long rainy day! The selection of burgers has great variety and is hard to whittle down to one choice, but I eventually went for the Miss Piggy - pork, chorizo, goat's cheese, red onion, tomato, and rocket - and wasn't disappointed.  The ingredients went very well together, and I was especially pleased to see the generous portions of rocket and red onion, which really help to counterbalance the saltiness of the other ingredients and add another set of textures.  And, crucially, the whole thing held its structural integrity depite being massive!  I washed it all down with...read more"
4.5,Really nice chips and burgers in a friendly setting. The onion rings are not to be missed. Anything that comes with Ballymaloe relish has my vote
4.0,Such tasty food! Would definitely recommend going here if you're a burger lover.. Very cheap prices and well worth the money! Great friendly and quick service too.. :)
3.5,"B√≥B√≥ offer some really tasty burgers. I've been here twice and each time I've really enjoyed my burger. The service is fast and friendly and there's no need to reserve a table. I went for the chunky chips but as Chucky chips go these were not my favourite - they were a tad bit greasy for my liking. They have a very good menu withs plenty of different burger options - not just beef. They also offer wings, pork dishes, chicken fillet , veggie options, lamb, fish and more! B√≥B√≥ offer some good deals on social media they're always running giveaways and there's a chance to win a free burger in the restaurant if you fill out a comment card."
4.0,"Cock a doodle do!!!! Well that was the name of the chicken burger I chose on my visit. Southern fried chicken goujons with red onion, mayo, lettuce and bbq sauce on a poppy seeded bun. As you can see you need to remove some of the chicken before eating it as a burger. The food was really good and the staff are very nice. The portion sizes are generous - you definitely get your money worth. You'll have plenty of choice - beef, pork, lamb, chicken, fish or veggie. Definitely worth a visit if you fancy a good burger!"
3.0,"I have a different experience nearly every time I go here. Burgers are always nice and packed with flavour and there's a pretty good variety. Staff are always either neutral or they forget our order/mix it up/it is delayed. Have had a few occasions where I have needed to chase them up for something I asked for several minutes previously. Kind of puts a dampner on the experience. Not a place I would go for the atmosphere but if you're just looking to eat and go, it works."
3.0,"Burgers here are good but not great. I ordered the Miss Piggy pork burger which was nice but nothing special. Staff were friendly but a little unorganised: firstly brought an incorrect order to our table and I had to ask for cutlery. Bobo's is reasonably priced however, and has a handy city centre location."
5.0,"Gorgeous food! I've been here a few times and have no complaints yet! Would recommend everyone to try here! Lots of deals on food, so cheap and lovely staff and place too"
3.5,Really really average food i had the bacon cheese burger and i felt i could have made it my self. Although the service was very quick and staff were friendly i cant see myself returning in a hurry.
4.0,This burger bar is surprisingly good! I'm not usually one for going for burgers but great shout ! I got the pork and chorizo burger which was v different but really good! Went here with a friend and we where both pretty happy with burgers and fries! Place was crazy busy and service was quite slow but over all it's good burgers and reasonably priced ?
3.5,I've had my best and worst burger here so maybe that doesn't bode well for consistency... But the best was so good it's hard to forget! I had the sun blush beef burger and skinny chips with rosemary mmmm so good! Definitely worth a try.
2.0,"For me, there are much, MUCH better burger joints in the area. Bobo's used to be great (especially the fish finger burger), they seem to have lost their way a bit. Could this be recommended over other burger joints in the area... no, but is it a decent runner up... sure! It's worth checking the menu to see if anything takes your fancy!"
4.0,"LOVE the place! Looked like a quaint little place from the outside, but it's actually pretty big. Lovely ambiance. It was a little chilly outside but the heaters are pretty strong and keep you warm. The service was very good. The girl who took our order was very friendly and patient. The food was really good. It was really well made and to our surprise the portion size was pretty big. We had Singapore Chicken Salad, Potato Bravas, a Cous Cous Salad and a Risotto dish. The potato bravas is a MUST HAVE, while I found the singapore chicken a bit too sweet for my palate. It was still well made though. Overall a good experience!"
4.5,"Loved the food and the staff where friendly but did not like the place in which we were seated to near the fire and the smoke from it sort of ruined my first experience of the place, although we will be going back tonight so I shall see how I get on."
3.0,"Overrated restaurant! Lovely space but the food the main thing a disappointment ! I ordered a ckicken burger , the chicken was over cooked and so dry that was so hard to eat. As a starter the famous wings , tasty but over spicy. As a desert as a attempt to save the meal a blueberry cheesecake but again not tasty at all . I would suggest the space to enjoy a drink at the terrace with sea view or try the seafood , that's it !"
4.5,This is a lovely place to have a drink or a to have a meal. They have different rooms inside and one terrace with sea view. Inside it's really cozy and the staff is really nice. The prices are ok and the food is really good.
4.0,"The Blue Bar is a big institution in Skerries. It's always best to book a table before going! We didn't, but luckily our waiting time was short.
Of course, I tried the famous buffalo wings, which were very delicious and just spicy enough. The blue cheese dip was very soft and yummy.
I ordered a side of coleslaw. I love coleslaw, so there's almost no way to get it wrong, and this one was very good.
The place is beautiful, very well decorated and with a dark, candlelight mood; super cozy. The staff is also nice.
The small platter of wings is very reasonably priced and served, you can get pretty satisfied with one."
3.5,"This was a spot I've been dying to try out for numerous reasons but the main one is for their so called 'award-winning wings'. Which I would have to disagree with majorly due to the fact that the sauce was just not my cup of tea, it had a very ketchup taste to it. While I was massively disappointed with the wings. This is a place I will definitely come back to as it's super picturesque and while the wings were a let down the rest of what we ordered was gorgeous. Next time I think I would go for some fish. Such a cute spot, super cosy and was pretty watching the sunset coming down, as well as very pleasant staff."
4.0,"Worth the trip from Dublin! Well known for its wings, it doesn't disappoint. Amazing place for comfort food! The wings are as good as you would expect: really crispy and tasty, spicy and a bit zesty sauce. Delicious!! We also got the baby back ribs and those were great, some of the best I got: falling off the bone and very yummy! Great shoe string like fries and good desserts, although the sticky toffee pudding was a bit on the dry side with just average toffee. Still, a good cake, just not as decadent as you would want! Great place, really worth the visit, you leave happy!!"
4.5,"Heard lots of great reviews about the chicken wings and certainly wasn't disappointed! They are quality. Meaty generous portions and the sauce is amazing. The blue cheese dip could be better. Really nice friendly staff and great atmosphere. I went Sunday day it was quite busy but wasn't waiting too long. definitely go back."
4.0,"One of my 'go-to' restaurants for chicken wings. Much nicer than the over-rated Elephant and Castle. I always order the large portion of wings as my main, with a side of their Rustic Fries. Sauce is very tasty! I usually skip dessert here and opt for one of the tasty ice cream options from Storm in a Teacup outside on the pier."
4.0,"It's quite a trek to Skerries even from the Northside but Blue Bar is worth the trip for the atmosphere alone, it's ALWAYS packed especially on a sunny day. It's a fun place to head for, the views are amazing if you're lucky enough to be in a window. Their famous wings are great but very heavily sauced, I think I prefer slightly lighter sauce myself!"

4.5,"Blue Bar is a lovely spot for food. It has a great location in Skerries overlooking the water. I absolutely love the wings here and usually always get them but the last time I went I decided to change things up.  I got the Thai beef salad and it was delicious! We arrived at lunch time and it wasn't too busy. I would definitely recommend this spot, especially if you haven't tried their wings yet!"
3.0,"Myself and friends went here last night celebrating a few birthdays, it wasn't anyone's first time being here. Our table wasn't ready for the time it was booked for so we were left waiting but staff were very friendly. I ordered a pear mojito in the mean time - lovely. I always find blues food to be quite average and if I don't order wings I feel like I'm left sitting there staring at the menu panicking what to order instead. I went with the chicken Caesar salad, it was nice. I also tried the wings and garlic bread, both delicious - it made me regret not ordering the wings. Others got the burger, wings, salmon, Singapore salad and a goats cheese dish. There were no complaints about the...read more"
4.5,This place is renowned for its long waits for a table and big portions of wings! I fancy myself a bit of a wing lover and I've found lately I've really gone off Blue wings! They just don't do it for me anymore. So yesterday I ordered one of their new dishes Rocket & Prawn Spaghetti with sun dried tomatoes in a juicy tomatoe sauce. There was a distinct lack of sun dried tomatoes which I was a bit peeved about as I was looking forward to them. We ordered cocktails to start instead of starters and I got the 'mint berry twist'... Absolutely delish! Overall everything was perfect apart from the slow service and our food and drinks coming out in dribs and drabs (something I hate!)
3.5,The cocktails we ordered were all delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. The chicken wings were gorgeous (as always). Unfortunately my burger was slightly overdone.
4.0,"Blue Bar is always consistent, the service is always great and so is the food. Went here on Friday night in a party of 7 and we were well looked after. The wings were wonderful as always (a must order) and everyone was happy with their mains - I had the Thai red curry with prawns, the sauce was so good. The only gripe our table had was the noise, it was so loud we couldn't hear one another, but it's a good complaint for the establishment, there was great atmosphere. A great spot with a great view of the harbour."
4.5,Love love love this place üíï Such a great view and great atmosphere in the place. Their food is so tasty and have a great selection. The staff are always so pleasant and helpful.
4.5,"I absolutely love blue bar, such a nice location and great food! The wings were phenomenal and if your going to make the trip out there I would definitely recommend them! I also got their toffee cheesecake which was delicious but very filling! Their mojitos were also made perfectly! Was overall really impressed! It came out to be a bit on the pricey side but it was so worth it!"
5.0,"I love going to Blue Bar! Their gambas pil pil is my favourite thing on the menu. The garlic and chilli works so well together. If you like prawns, you're going to LOVE the pil pil. It's on the starters but I have that for my main with chips which are also amazing! For a starter I have a small wings, get the large if you're going to share. The large is way too big to have as a starter and perhaps too big as a main. I've tried and still had about 11 left, I was so full. The salt and chilli squid is another tasty starter. I've had the salads as a main but haven't been blown away by them. The cod and chips is delicious if you're a fish lover. I've had a few of their desserts and my...read more"
4.0,"I go to Blue Bar a good bit as they are famous for there wings ! The atmosphere is great and the environment is lovely for an evening out with friends . The view is also fabulous . Today I got the wings for starter and then another started of squid for my main . I am not a big fan of wings at all but The wings were lovely and they always are . The squid was also great . The meals are slightly over priced because it is such a popular restaurant . However the staff are very rude which is a big let down . They got our table reservation wrong and left us waiting . They were also rude when waiting our table . This is blue bars only let down but I will go back ."
5.0,"Have been to the blue bar loads of times, It's so worth the visit to skerries if you are a chicken wing fanatic..! Would also recommend the chicken and ribs üç¥ I'm not crazy for seafood but heard it's amazing from here! They have a great new menu and you can now book a table ahead (it used to be just walk in) ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4.0,"Fab, casual dining on the harbour in skerries. The chowder is delicious but I also got a portion of wings that came highly recommend to me by my son. Get a table outside if the sun is shining!"
4.0,This place is well known for its chicken wings but the past two times I've left disappointed by them. After a break away from it I decided to give it a go again and I'm so happy I did because the wings were back to a 10/10! We shared a small portion between three people for starters (so that's around 3 wings each plenty for just a nibble) and for my main I had the Cajun chicken burger with no bun. The chicken was very tender and the others got beef burgers which were really well flavoured. The servers are always so friendly and the place is always buzzing with atmosphere. Very enjoyable meal.
5.0,"Honestly cannot rate this place any higher ! Blue bar has everything you want in a casual restaurant from the views, the interior to the unbelievable menu . The food here is Always good and it's obvious why this place is always packed. It's been said by many that they probably do the best wings in Dublin ! Many different salads, burgers and amazing desserts to choose from. But you can't go here without getting even a starter portion of the wings you won't be disappointed :)"
4.5,"I came here with friends and we ordered half the menu! Everything was gorgeous! Especially the wings, I can see now why they are lovin dublins #2 best wings in Dublin"
2.5,"I heard such amazing reviews of the chicken wings in Blue Bar I had to pay a visit. 45mins drive from the city out to Skerries had my appetite primed. The room was filled with lovely booths but as there were only 2 of us we were seated at a high table at the bar which was a bit off-putting as the bar staff were working on top of us. After much deliberation we decided to split a portion of wings and a pulled pork sandwich but were disappointed to discover there was no pulled pork available. We ordered 2 large portions of wings on advice from the waitress but soon discovered that one large portion would have been LOADS for 2 hungry people, disappointing as the portions were ‚Ç¨14 each...read more"
4.0,"We arrived Friday evening and the atmosphere was great, however upon sitting down a duet began singing and the volume of the speakers made it so no one could hear each other at the table and had to shout. This continued for about half an hour until it was fixed. Once this was sorted the experience we had was fantastic. Servers were excellent, food was delicious and portion sizes were very generous. I had the giant skyscraper burger but I will be definitely back to try the ribs. All in all a great spot to go to!"
4.0,"We ordered a burger and some wings, and both were really delicious. The meat on the burger was juicy and soft. The have outdoor and indoor dining, the music is a little loud indoors. The only downside is that the glass of soft drinks is way too small. You basically pay for a can of Coke and get 1/3 of that can in a glass. Other than that, it‚Äôs great."

2.0,Very poor service last time I was there as was the food. Mac and cheese was runny and tasteless and the pull pork bap was covered in grease. It was a Thursday but I would have expected better.
5.0,Highly recommend a trip to this restaurant! Anything I've ordered here has been amazing. On my last trip I got the small nachos which as you can see in the picture they aren't so small! All their dishes are quite large but they do offer some tasty lighter salad dishes which pack just as much flavour.
